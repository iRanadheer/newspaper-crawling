"National Centre of Polar and Ocean Research has found a dramatic decline in #Arctic sea ice due to #GlobalWarming", 25-Jun-2020,,"In the last 40 years (1979-2018), sea ice has been declining at a rate of ‘-4.7% /decade, while its rate was found to be ‘-13%’ in July 2019. The National Centre of Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) has found a dramatic decline in the Arctic sea ice due to global warming. The decline of sea ice has led to a localised increase in evaporation, air humidity, cloud cover, and rainfall. Arctic sea ice is a sensitive indicator of climate change and has strong retaliatory effects on other components of the climate system. The sea ice has been declining at a rate of ‘-4.7%’ per decade. If this decline continues with the same rate, there would be no ice left in the Arctic sea by 2050, which would be dangerous for humanity and the entire environment. The data collected with the help of satellite from 1979 to 2019, NCPOR has tried to understand the rate of surface warming and the changes in global atmospheric circulation. The study shows the decrease of the Arctic sea ice area and the increase in summer and autumn seasons have affected the local weather and climate over the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas. Being a sensitive indicator of climate change, the loss of ice cover in the Arctic sea has had strong feedback effects on other components of the climate system such as prevention or reduction of heat and momentum, water vapour, and other material exchange between the atmosphere and the sea. The worrying element to note is that the volume of ice formation during winters is unable to keep pace with the volume of ice loss during summers. Dr Avinash Kumar, a senior scientist at NCPOR, said. “In the background of the global warming scenario, the study reveals that global ocean-atmospheric warming has enhanced the Arctic sea ice loss. The study demonstrated the application of satellite observations and model reanalysis data for the determination and validation of the 2019 sea-ice extent tied to the second-lowest sea-ice minimum record. Although there are no extreme weather events recorded this year, an accelerated decline in sea-ice extent and sea-ice volume in summer 2019 was dominant, and also the northern hemisphere has experienced record high-temperature rise especially during the spring and summer months”. Dr Avinash added, “The sea-ice loss at this rate, concerning to all the lives on Earth, can have a catastrophic impact due to rising global air temperature and slowing down of global ocean water circulation”. Led by Dr Avinash Kumar, the research team comprised Juhi Yadav and Rahul Mohan of NCPOR, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Goa. `The research paper has been published in the Journal of Natural Hazards.

Skill development will be the backbone of Atmnirbhar Bharat and Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyaan: Dr Mahendra Nath Pandey, 29-Jun-2020,,"Union Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Dr Mahendra Nath Pandey,  today said that skilling, up-skilling and re-skilling of India’s workforce would play a crucial role in the success of the Government’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyaan. The government is soon to get approval on the next phase of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, focused on demand is driven skill development, digital technology and skills about Industry 4.0. “We need to focus on employment in the current scenario, and that’s why we will be focusing upon demand-based skilling in the next phase of PMKVY, where we have added certain aspects like - strengthening district skill committees and connecting with local employment offices. District Commissioner and State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) will also have a crucial role to play and will be connected to the industry bodies so that we can bridge the demand-supply gap and impart relevant training to the migrant labourers who have returned to their home state,” said Dr Mahendra Nath Pandey. He also said that if required, the government would give permission to run PMKVY centres and Industrial Training Institutes in 2-3 shifts. He urged the industry to expand their operations from big cities to small districts and villages and invest in upskilling and re-skilling the youth across rural India which would help make a giant leap towards the success of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan. “We invite private sector people to come forward and impart training and focus on being vocal for local product and services empowering youth to drive local economic growth.” Dr Mahendra Nath Pandey added He further said, “I appeal to the industry to be more compassionate towards the migrant labour, do their counselling, treat them respectfully and facilitate those who intend to return and get back to work.” Dr Mahendra Nath Pandey said, “Our neighbouring country is trying to remove its blot and working on expansionist policy, but it is also able to understand now that this time around it has a strong opponent and it will further get to know this thing more clearly as our entire nation stands united.” He further informed, “We plan to simplify further the apprenticeship which is the on-the-job model of skill training so that industries do not hesitate in absorbing apprentices and they do so enthusiastically. We shall invite suggestions from the industry on that, our proposal is going ahead with whatever discussions we took in the past in this regard.” The Minister also said that his Ministry is working closely with other central ministries and state governments on compiling data of skilled persons across the country which would be made available at a single click. “The database of skilled youth in the country will also the registered data of people who have come in from overseas as a part of reverse migration. NSDC, the implementation arm of MSDE, has come up with an effective application called ‘Swades’ whereby both Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Civil Aviation is also cooperating in collating this information and segregating the workforce basis their skills so that they can later be connected with opportunities of employment within the country and add to their personal and nation’s overall growth.” He stated that about 20,800 people have connected through the Swades app already. “In future, we plan to use their skill on a bigger scale and also seek the help of industry bodies in utilising their skills and promote them as trainers as we go ahead.” “In the wake of the Covid-19 global pandemic we need to move ahead with innovative methods, especially in the industrial sector, there is a need for a big change in terms of the overall mindset and approach towards doing business as we need to give more importance to use of digital technology,” said the Dr Mahendra Nath Pandey. In his welcome remarks, ASSOCHAM president, Dr Niranjan Hiranandani said, “Industry will willingly work in tandem with the government to jointly fight this battle and support the Hon’blePrime Minister in his vision of New Atmnirbhar Bharat.” Maninder Nayyar, co-chairman, ASSOCHAM National Council on Skill Development said, “Post Covid-19, new sectors and avenues of working are set to emerge, requiring new levels of skill, as such government and industry need to predict the possibilities of the future and prepare for them today itself.” (Source: PIB)",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/29/Skill-development-will-be-the-backbone-of-Atmnirbhar-Bharat-and-Garib-Kalyan-Rozgar-Abhiyaan-Dr-Mahendra-Nath-Pandey.html
"Clean Energy Can Support India’s Economic Recovery post-Covid-19", 30-Jun-2020,,"Covid-19 has presented significant demand- and supply-side challenges for India’s transport and power sectors, from liquidity constraints and supply shortages to shifts in consumer demand and preferences. NITI Aayog and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) today released Towards a Clean Energy Economy: Post-Covid-19 Opportunities for India’s Energy and Mobility Sectors report, which advocates for stimulus and recovery efforts that work towards building a clean, resilient, and least-cost energy future for India. These efforts include electric vehicle, energy storage, and renewable energy programs. The report identifies how Covid-19 is beginning to influence the clean energy transition in India, specifically for the transport and power sectors, and recommends principles and strategic opportunities for the country’s leaders to drive economic recovery and maintain momentum towards a clean energy economy. Rajiv Kumar, Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog said he is confident that India’s economy will recover following the containment of the Covid-19 pandemic. “India’s strong democratic institutions promote policy stability. Ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country's growth rate ahead of peers,” he said. “Clean energy will be a major driver of India’s economic recovery and international competitiveness,” added Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog. “We must look at how to leverage our domestic innovation ecosystem to bring value to the country and industry in this new normal. We have recommended specific actions by which India can revive two of our economic powerhouses—the transport and power sectors—and emerge stronger.” The report lays out four principles as a framework for policymakers and other key decision-makers considering programmes to support India’s clean energy future, invest in least-cost-energy solutions, support resilient and secure energy systems, prioritise efficiency and competitiveness, and promote social and environmental equity. “India needs to identify strategic opportunities for economic recovery in the short, medium, and long terms that can translate challenges posed by the pandemic into clean energy transition opportunities” said Anil Srivastava, Principal Consultant and Mission Director, NITI Aayog. Opportunities in the transport sector include making public transport safe, enhancing and expanding non-motorized transport infrastructure, reducing vehicle kilometres travelled through work-from-home where possible, supporting national strategies to adopt electric vehicles in the freight and passenger segments, and making India an automotive export hub. In the power sector, opportunities include improving the electricity distribution business and its operations, enabling renewables and distributed energy resources, and promoting energy resilience and local manufacturing of renewable energy and energy storage technologies. “The principles and opportunities in the report can provide guidance to India’s public and private sector leaders on how to evaluate and prioritize stimulus and recovery options that continue to invest in a long-term clean energy future for India,” said Akshima Ghate, Director, RMI India. “Covid-19 has disrupted the world and affected everyone’s lives,” said Clay Stranger, senior director, Rocky Mountain Institute. “As India looks to recovery efforts, clean energy and mobility systems can make a more resilient India by bolstering manufacturing, enhancing the reliability of electricity, avoiding costly oil imports, and cleaning the air.” The report states that India’s transport sector can save 1.7 gigatonnes of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions and avoid about 600 million tonnes of oil equivalent in fuel demand by 2030 through shared, electric, and connected passenger mobility and cost-effective, clean, and optimized freight transport. Significant savings are also achievable in the power sector through the adoption of renewable energy, energy storage, efficiency, and flexible generation and demand.

PM chairs meeting to review planning and preparations for vaccination against Covid-19, 30-Jun-2020,,"Prime Minister Modi today chaired a high-level meeting to review the planning and preparations for vaccination against Covid-19, as and when the vaccine is available. PM noted that vaccination of India’s vast and diverse population will need to factor in issuesincluding those related to management of medical supply chains, prioritisation of at-risk populations, coordination between different agencies involved in the process, as well as the role of private sector and civil society in this national endeavour. Prime Minister Modi enunciated four guiding principles that will form the foundation of this national effort: first, that vulnerable groups should be identified and prioritised for early vaccination, for example doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, non-medical frontline corona warriors, and vulnerable people among the general population; second, that vaccination of “anyone, anywhere” should take place,ie without imposition of any domicile related restrictions for getting the vaccine; third, that vaccination must be affordable and universal - no person should be left behind; and fourth, that the entire process from production to vaccination should be monitored and supported in real time with the use of technology. PM directed officials to evaluate in a broad manner available technology options that can form the backbone of the national endeavor to vaccinate all in the most efficient and timely manner. Prime Minister directed that detailed planning for such large scale vaccination should be undertaken immediately. The current status of vaccine development efforts were also reviewed at the meeting.

"Indian Navy Completes “Operation Samudra Setu”", 08-Jul-2020,,"Operation Samudra Setu, which was launched on May 5, 2020 as part of the national effort to repatriate Indian citizens from overseas during the COVID-19 pandemic has culminated after successfully bringing 3,992 Indian citizens back to their homeland by sea. Indian Naval Ships Jalashwa (Landing Platform Dock), and Airavat, Shardul and Magar (Landing Ship Tanks) participated in this operation which lasted over 55 days and involved traversing more then 23,000 kilometers by sea.  Indian Navy has previously undertaken similar evacuation operations as part of Operation Sukoon in 2006 (Beirut) and Operation Rahat in 2015 (Yemen). The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impact on ships and seafarers due to the compact environment and forced ventilation systems onboard ships.  It was in these trying times and difficult conditions that the Indian Navy took up the challenge to evacuate our distressed citizens from overseas. The greatest challenge for the Indian Navy was to avoid any incident of outbreak of infection onboard the ships during the evacuation operation. Rigorous measures were planned and medical/ safety protocols unique to the operating environment of ships were implemented.  These were strictly followed onboard the ships undertaking Op Samudra Setu resulting in the safe return of 3,992 of our citizens to their homeland. Operation Samudra Setu was undertaken utilising Indian Naval ships best suited for the operation, catering for COVID-19 related social distancing norms vis-à-vis medical arrangements and carrying capacity. Ships used for the operation were specially provisioned and the Sick Bay or the clinic onboard was especially equipped with COVID-19 related equipment and facilities.  Women Officers and military nursing staff were also embarked for the women passengers. Basic amenities and medical facilities were provided to all evacuees during sea passage on these ships.  One of the expectant mothers who undertook passage on Jalashwa, Mrs Sonia Jacob, also gave birth to a baby boy within a few hours of reaching Kochi on International Mother’s Day. Indian Naval ships Jalashwa, Airavat, Shardul and Magar steamed more then 23,000 kilometres during Operation Samudra Setu and undertook the evacuation operation in a smooth and coordinated manner. Along with other Government agencies, the Indian Navy has also been at the forefront of national efforts to assist our citizens.  Indian Naval IL-38 and Dornier aircraft have been used for ferrying of doctors and COVID-19 related material across the country. Indian Naval personnel also innovated various customised equipment such as Personnel Protection Equipment Nav Rakshak, hand-held temperature sensors, assisted respiratory system, 3-D printed face shield, portable multi-feed oxygen manifold, ventilators, air-evacuation stretcher pod, baggage disinfectants etc. Most of these innovations were carried on board the ships undertaking Operation Samudra Setu and niche equipment was also provided to host countries from where evacuation was undertaken. Indian Navy utilised its amphibious sea-lift ships for Operation Samudra Setu, which has reinforced the flexibility and reach of these multi-faceted platforms. Whilst Jalashwa, Magar, Airavat and Shardul were undertaking Operation Samudra Setu, another Landing Ship (Tank) Kesari undertook ‘Mission SAGAR’, carrying 580 tonnes of food aid and medical stores including ayurvedic medicines to Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Comoros Islands and Seychelles, covering over 14,000 km in 49 days. One medical team each was also deployed at Mauritius and Comoros Island as part of the mission. The 3,992 Indian citizens evacuated during Operation Samudra Setu were disembarked at various ports as indicated in the table above and entrusted to the care of respective state authorities. This operation was undertaken by the Indian Navy in close coordination with Ministry of External Affairs, Home Affairs, health and various other agencies of the Government of India and State Governments.

""It is currently centred 690 km away from Mumbai, and the sea conditions are very rough, with winds of speed 45-50kmph over the sea. The wind-speed would increase to 70kmph on Tuesday when it becomes a cyclone and then increase up to 90-115 kmph on June 3 when it could cross Gujarat and north Maharashtra coast as a severe cyclonic storm,"" said M. Mohapatra, Director General of Meteorology (DGM), IMD. ""Systems which are formed along with the monsoon tend to carry much more rains, so it is expected that this could bring extreme rains over the coastal areas. The low-lying area could get inundated, especially the urban areas. We are continuously informing the local and central government authorities as we update the forecast,"" M. Mohapatra, (DGM), IMD added. It has been advised to fishers from all the coastal states including Karnataka, Goa, Kerala, Maharashtra and Gujarat not to venture into the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep area till June 4 and urged those in the sea to return immediately. The warning from the IMD comes after a week of cyclone Amphan which has destruction in West Bengal and Odisha.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/2/Cyclone-Nisagra-to-hit-Western-Coast.html

Did CCP infiltrate the UN system beyond the WHO?, 22-Apr-2020,,"The nexus between China and organisations like the  The events of recent weeks have laid bare the perfidy of the World Health Organisation, the inter-governmental agency of the United Nations whose task it is to coordinate and support technically UN member states' responses to public health. The WHO, which has been under fire for well over a decade for sins of commission and omission both, including its disastrous mishandling in 2014 of the Ebola outbreak in several countries of Africa, is now facing an inquisition about its dereliction of duties concerning the coronavirus pandemic before which all its previous crises - Ebola, misgovernance, budgetary profligacy - pale. To blame for the predicament the WHO finds itself in are its top executives of course, but more pertinently, a global pharmaceutical mob whose rapine drove the agency into the grasp of the country that wants, more than any other in the world, to control international agendas, and that country is the People's Republic of China. The China that the world has seen and imagined, for a generation now, is in some ways not all that removed from what it was in the 1950s, under the new Communist government, nor from what it was in the 1920s, under the Nationalist government. When in 1929 the Nationalist government proposed to abolish traditional medicine in China, a countrywide strike was called which shut clinics and pharmacies.  The result was the creation of two systems, one for traditional medicine practitioners, the other for Western medicine doctors. In the 1950s, with the country having been ravaged by war, doctors were in desperately short supply. The Communists pragmatically surveyed what remained of the traditional medicine institutions and regulations, found they were mostly intact, and managed with them. It was the Communists who formally coined the term that has been used since then, Traditional Chinese Medicine, even though Chairman Mao considered its practitioners to be no more than ""circus entertainers or street hawkers"". When the Cultural Revolution was whipped up from the mid-1960s into the conflagration that mindlessly consumed the country's literature, music and arts, and banished China's cultural practitioners to asylums, or had them executed by firing squads, the traditional medicine institutions lived to cure another day by shutting down. For ten years they stayed shut, and when they reopened at last, they did so as Chinese 'people's science' centres with all the 'tradition' hammered out of them. As Communist China became the  'factory of the world', it studied with care the institutions of the West, meticulously dissected the mechanisms of the multilateral order. It was when Jiang Zemin was president of China and Li Peng (of Tiananmen Square infamy) the premier that a woman named Margaret Chan was appointed Director of Health of Hong Kong, then still a British colony. That was in 1994. Nine years later, Dr Chan joined the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a director of one of its departments. Two years thereafter, in 2005, she was appointed director of a more weighty department as well as 'Representative of the Director-General for Pandemic Influenza' and in September of that year, Assistant Director-General for Communicable Diseases. The very next year, 2006, Dr Chan was elected to the post of Director-General of WHO. Hu Jintao was president of the People's Republic at the time (his premier, Wen Jiabao, with Xi Jinping a vice president). It was during Hu's tenure that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) crisis of 2003 swept China, which was roundly criticised for initially covering up and responding too slowly. Between then and now, the parallels are unmistakeable. A national epidemic that is also global, the Chinese Communist Party is slow off the mark to respond and to inform the world, an ally at the top in the WHO, the equivalent of show trials to deflect accountability. But there are signal differences too. Between Sars and Covid, the globalised economy of manufactures and services that has knit and reknit the world has been directed more, year after successive year, by China. As it grew in heft and bulk as the 'factory of the world', Communist China studied with care the institutions of the West, meticulously dissected the mechanisms of the multilateral order. Its trading surpluses (and its no-strings-attached lines of credit to the capital-starved members of the formerly Third World) fostered the vision of a China that had subscribed fully to the liberal-democratic ideals of an international order, and which was now supporting it with its formidable treasury and its technical prowess. For an agency like the WHO, one of the most prominent amongst the many agencies and specialist sections in the byzantine United Nations System, the balancing of its books of accounts has from the outset been subordinated to its role as being one of the UN's fulcrum points with which to curb (or boost) a particular bloc's, or a country's, international political reach. Just as the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation has done with the multinational crop, food, fertiliser and bio-technology corporations, or as the UN Development Programme has done with the burgeoning private technical consultancies of Europe, the WHO is the court at which the multinational pharmaceutical and drugs corporations must swear fealty so as to partake in the banquet that follows when a particular line of public health policy is adopted by a country or region. It is a partnership (as the WHO and the UN prefer to call such relationships) that was thought up by the agency during Dr Chan's second term. Going by the name of the Framework for Engagement with Non-State Actors, the new mechanism that the WHO blandly calls a 'multi-stakeholder governance system' was signed into effect in 2016, a year before the departure of Dr Chan and the arrival of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. For the loyal agent of the Chinese Communist Party, Dr Chan's final gambit could well be the feint that obscured - if only till 2020 - the real game afoot. Like other major agencies of the UN, the WHO’s budget is financed through a mix of what are called 'assessed' and 'voluntary' contributions. Assessed contributions are mandatory contributions from the member states (countries) according to a formula based on the size of their economies and populations. In the early 1970s, a full three-quarters of the WHO budget came from assessed contributions. By 1989, the balance between the two kinds of contributions was even. By 2015 (when the WHO budget was US$2.3 billion) assessed contributions had dropped to less than a quarter. What until then had been considered voluntary contributions added up to barely US$120 million. The rest of what was accounted for as voluntary contributions came from other UN agencies, 'partnerships' (such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the Global Vaccines Alliance) and foundations (mainly the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). Most of these voluntary contributions were tied to specific WHO programmes. Against such a background, civil society groups around the world raised an alarm against the Framework for Engagement with Non-State Actors, saying that it ""legitimises the framing of public health problems and solutions in favour of the interests and agendas of those actors"". All entirely true. However, the actual plot had moved to a different theatre. That theatre had begun to be constructed well over a decade earlier in first a few, then several more countries in Africa. It took the form of Chinese development and infrastructural aid and had rapidly reached a point in 2012 where the presence of Chinese corporations in Africa and the Chinese Communist Party's brigades of representatives in the capital cities were called the re-colonisation of Africa. After many countries in Africa fell into the trap of Chinese development and infrastructural aid, the presence of Chinese corporations in Africa increased which led to a re-colonisation of Africa. So firmly set on this campaign were Beijing's party mandarins that in 2015, the People's Republic was confident enough to promise US$60 billion in grants and commercial loans to finance economic development projects in Africa, and confident enough to expect that most of it would be agreed to by the leaders of African countries. The confidence was not misplaced. By 2018, China held 15 percent of sub-Saharan Africa’s total debt stock and is the largest owner of public debt in Africa. Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, has had Chinese funding poured into it, with the Chinese Communist Party constructing everything from the metro system to highways and skyscrapers, plus the US$200 million headquarters of the African Union. When the Ethiopia-Djibouti railway was built, the Export-Import Bank of China backed the project with US$3.3 billion in loans, and 400 Chinese investment projects valued at more than US$4 billion were counted in 2019 as operating in the country. That is why Tedros was the ideal puppet for China, because the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front  - a Marxist party - to which he belonged was already a junior partner. It had first sent a senior delegation to Beijing in 1994 for “China’s advice on Ethiopia’s development”. During the Warring States period (fifth to third centuries before the Common Era) of historical China, several rival states battled each other viciously for territorial advantage and dominance. It was during this period that the general known as Sun Tzu is thought to have directed some battles, following which his pithy doctrines were compiled. One of them, which the ultimately victorious Qin state adopted, has been translated as, ""Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.” The 25 Politburo members of the Chinese Communist Party favour and implement such tactics. And that is how Dr Margaret Chan was the first to be placed in a UN agency. As of today, the successful staging of such tactics has led to four UN agencies now led by Chinese nationals. In August 2019,  China’s former vice-minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Qu Dongyu, became Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Fang Liu is the Secretary General of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), Houlin Zhao is Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Li Yong is Director-General of the UN Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO). Had there not been a reversal in the voting pattern early in March 2020 for the election of the Director of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), a fifth Chinese national would have been added to this contemporary list of dominance. This is a record for any country in what is called the UN System and augurs ill for the future of that system and, more saliently, for what is understood as multilateralism. Nor is that all. China has placed seven of its nationals as Deputy Directors-General of UN agencies, also a record. China’s mandatory contribution to the UN budget is now second only to the United States of America, and it has also put in place a Peace and Development Fund whose allocation is decided jointly by Chinese diplomats and the UN Secretary-General, and no-one else. Besides, six heads of major UN agencies are from Africa, and from countries into which the People's Republic has, 'no strings attached', poured aid, development assistance, infrastructure and of course trading companies. India should decrease its dependence on China for any product and increase its exports to regions which are dependant on China. India has to complement countries that have fallen into the trap of Chinese hegemony. For India, the alarm should have been rung out of its socket several years ago, when the imports by the Indian pharmaceutical and bulk drug manufacturers of active pharmaceutical ingredients from China crossed the 25% threshold. It is only when the factories in China switched off, and the flow of these ingredients stopped, that the country learnt about this import dependency which in February 2020 was found to be around 65% - in 1991 it was less than a percent. India's exports to the Africa region (54 countries) are dominated by pharmaceutical products. It has become abundantly clear that India's strategies for the People's Republic of China, for the economic colonies of China (such as Sri Lanka which seeks to escape the Beijing debt trap, and Cambodia, which is sinking further into it) and for the United Nations, need to complement one another. Especially for our major line ministries that are exposed to UN agency 'country cooperation strategies' (as they are called by the UN), every agreement, every clause in those agreements and every interaction with UN staff at any level must now be vetted and re-assessed. Doing so is particularly important for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Ayush Ministry, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation and the Department of Telecommunications (Ministry of Communications). Sun Tzu's fabled advice has become a staple in business management schools, despite the lack of a reliable historical record for the alleged Chinese general. Our heroes, on the other hand, were firmly flesh-and-blood, and vanquished in their time all comers, never mind Chinese phantoms. So must we.

NIA knocks on CMO’s doors, 21-Jul-2020,,"Kerala Chief Minister Vijayan's throne shakes as the Opposition parties demand his resignation over the involvement of his office in the gold smuggling scam which has ‘serious implications’ for national security As National Investigation Agency (NIA) switched probe into possible terror funding angle in the case, the Kerala Gold Smuggling scam has thrust the office of Kerala Chief Minister Vijayan into a political firestorm once again after the controversial Sprinklr scam. In one of the biggest seizures in recent times, 30 kg of gold that smuggled into Kerala through Thiruvananthapuram airport was recovered by the Customs officials on July 4. The consignment worth Rs 15 crore, was found camouflaged in ‘diplomatic baggage’ which addressed to UAE consular general, Thiruvananthapuram. The CPM and the LDF Government were in spotlight from the day one as there were allegations that the CMO intervened and tried to clear the baggage. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s close aide and his principal secretary M Sivsankar is now accused of helping Swapna Suresh, one of the key accused in the case. As soon as the case was taken over by National Investigation Agency (NIA), the national agency had arrested the prime accused in Kerala gold smuggling case Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair, who were on the run following the gold seizure, from Bengaluru on July 10. NIA took over the case, citing the organised smuggling operation may have ‘serious implications’ for national security. All the accused have been charged with offences under various sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Chief Minister’s Office & Smuggling Syndicate Swapna was employed in Space Park and Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Limited (KSITL), which comes under the IT department, a portfolio held by Kerala Chief Minister. When customs interrogated an Ex PRO of the UAE consulate named Sarith, who is also an accused in the case, it has been found that Swapna has forged the Consulate documents to take advantage of the diplomatic immunity. 100 kg of gold smuggled into Kerala each month Even though the Chief Minister has been maintaining that Swapna was appointed by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the suspension order of Sivasankar has revealed that he had played a pivotal role in appointing her as Operations Manager/Junior Consultant in the Space Park project under Kerala State Information Technology Infrastructure Ltd (KSITIL). The suspension order of Sivankar has disproved the false claims of CM Vijayan and raised more serious questions over his office’s involvement in the case. During the appointment, the state government had ignored a crime branch case and adverse remarks by the intelligence wing. As per call data records, Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, found in regular touch with the key accused Sarith and Swapna. Sivashankar was interrogated by Customs officials for nine hours. Customs is investigating his links with Swapna Suresh and whether he used his office to facilitate the gold smuggling in any form. According to reports, the NIA will soon question Sivsankar. Chief Minister Vijayan had been defending his close confidante Sivasankar until when he was suspended from the service on Thursday. Sivsankar has been considered to be the blue-eyed boy of CM Vijayan ever since the LDF govt came to power. Sivsankar, as IT secretary came to the rescue of CM Vijayan when the Sprinklr data scam rocked the LDF Government earlier this year. The Opposition has said the NIA should question the Chief Minister and that he should resign taking moral responsibility for the acts of his principal secretary. CPM and Smuggling Syndicate The call data records between former SIMI leader and present minister KT Jaleel and the accused Swapna Suresh showed that as many as 16 calls were made between them. While Jaleel called Swapna eight times, she called him once.  UAE attaché was deported in 2013 Speaking to media, Jaleel claimed that he had spoken to Swapna only about distribution of ‘Ramzan food kits’ from the UAE consulate. “The consulate used to distribute food kits during Ramzan. This year, it didn’t happen due to the lockdown. So, the consul-general messaged me on May 27 expressing his wish to distribute the food kits and I agreed to make arrangements through Consumerfed. The consul-general messaged me that Swapna would contact me,” he said. According to the data, the phone calls were made two months ago. Contrary to the justification of Jaleel, Swapna was no longer working with the consulate during Ramzan period as she left the job in 2019 itself. Meanwhile, Jaleel’s admission that he had accepted sponsorship for food kits worth Rs 5 lakh from UAE consular general have raised serious questions about his integrity. The incident also amounts to serious violation of protocols by a minister while dealing with foreign missions and diplomats. Experts and ex-diplomats suggest that the revelation is equally damaging to the UAE consul general as he too seems to have breached the code of conduct for diplomats. Several top CPM leaders, including the Chief Minister Vijayan, Speaker of state assembly P Sreeramakrishnan and others, are now facing heat over their alleged involvement in the controversial gold smuggling case. The opposition served a notice to the Kerala Assembly secretary seeking to remove Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan from the post for his links with Swapna. The Speaker had also inaugurated a shop belonging to one of the accused Sandeep. In 2017, during CPM’s Janajagrata Yatra (march to keep the people vigilant) CPM ended up exposing his bonhomie with smuggling network in broad day light. CPM state secretary Balakrishnan led the yatra by getting into a ‘Mini Cooper’ owned by one Karat Faizal, a notorious smuggler and younger brother of the CPM-backed MLA of Koduvally, Karat Razak. BJP state secretary K. Surendran was the first to puncture the yatra by posting on Facebook the picture of a beaming Kodiyeri in the vehicle, now found to be falsely registered in neighbouring Puducherry.  BJP to launch protest against LDF Government In 2013, CCTV visuals surfaced on media in which Fayaz, an accused in several gold smuggling cases, visiting Central jail, Kannur wearing Arab costume. The visit was to meet some CPM leaders who were in jail in connection with the murder of CPM rebel T P Chandrasekharan.  UAE attaché leaves India With the investigating agencies arresting two more individuals, Muhammad Anwar TM and Saidalvi E in connection with the case, Rashed Khamis Ali Musaiqri Alshemeli, the admin attache of the UAE Consulate in Thiruvananthapuram left India for the UAE. The bag containing the gold, which Swapna Suresh and Sarith tried to smuggle, was addressed to Attache, who was in charge of the consulate in Thiruvananthapuram. The on-going investigations by Customs and NIA have already divulged the role of Rashid Al Ashmiya in the case as the key accused in the case Swapna and Sarith gave testimonies against him before the investigation agencies. The call data records confirmed that the admin attaché of the UAE Consulate, Rashid Khamis had been in touch with Swapna Suresh. Attache’s number was also on the call list of the key accused Swapna.  Gold meant for anti-CAA protests? Taking into account the striking similarities between the two incidents (the recent one and that of 2013), an ex-intelligence official told Organiser that the involvement of the UAE embassy in the incident should be viewed seriously by the investigation agencies and the country’s political leadership. Smuggling on the rise during Covid-19 “Since the UAE Consul General in-charge is involved in the case, it has been proved beyond doubt that the gold was not meant for any business purpose. Some UAE Islamist leaders and businesspersons under the spell of ISI had jumped on the bandwagon of the protests against CAA in India. There were media reports that several NRIs who were working in India were fired from jobs, citing their allegiance to the ruling BJP.  The vested-interests of the state and non-state actors in West Asia were clearly evident from the reactions from various corners during the anti-CAA propaganda,” he said. According to the ex-intelligence official, who is a known national security expert, the smuggled gold could be used for financing the anti-CAA protests and other terrorist activities across the country. “These days, the stringent laws and strict regulations made hawala transactions nearly impossible and it has been replaced by the smuggled gold as a new means of terror funding,” he added. Swapna Suresh and Sandeep in NIA custody Islamist-Communist Smuggling syndicate The role of Kerala-based Islamist outfits in the recent anti-Hindu riots in Delhi, which was orchestrated as part of the anti-CAA protests, was exposed in the investigations conducted by the Delhi police. The police have already established its links with Islamist preacher Zakir Naik, Saudi Arabia and Islamist terrorist outfits like PFI. The Accused Ishrat Jahan and Khalid Saifi got funds from unaccounted channels and PFI respectively as well as from abroad. Permitting NIA probe in the case, MHA Spokesperson had stated that the organised smuggling operation may have ‘serious implications’ for national security. The NIA has also maintained in the court that the purpose of the smuggling was to fund terrorism.  Faizal Fareed, the third accused in the gold smuggling case was arrested from Dubai in United Arab Emirates on July 19. The Dubai Police took Fareed into custody on Thursday. He is being questioned at the Al Rashidiya Police Station in Dubai. He is expected to be handed over to India at the earliest.  The NIA had initiated the process for issuing an Interpol Blue Corner notice against Faizal Fareed. According to reports, Fareed has arranged for the gold that was smuggled through the diplomatic channel into Kerala. Faizal is believed to have connections with Islamist outfits-based in Kerala that led the anti-CAA protests. A section of media had reported in favour of Fareed, projecting him a victim of ‘fake news and whitewashing his ‘business’ in UAE. Adding support to the assumptions, Malappuram native K T Rameez held by Customs was found to be held for gold smuggling to Kerala. He was suspected to be the mastermind of gold smuggling using diplomatic channels. According to the customs, he has a criminal background and was earlier booked for smuggling gold and hunting deer. Rameez is a close relative of Muslim League leader and former state education minister, the late Chakkeeri Ahamed Kutty. In the court, the NIA strongly had argued that no bail should be permitted for Swapna Suresh and other accused since they have been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The counsel had informed that they have strong evidence against Swapna Suresh, Sandeep Nair and Sarith that they were involved in the gold smuggling racket and they should be interrogated by the agency to find out the emerging links. ISIS issues threat to Janam TV Meanwhile, the CPM has chosen to defend the state government in the scam and has alleged that the gold smuggling case in Kerala is being used by the BJP and the Congress to destabilise the LDF government in the state. They also alleged that the issue is being used to target Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The gold smuggling case in Kerala is being used by the Congress-led UDF and the BJP to tarnish the image of the LDF government and (is) a joint effort to destabilise the government headed by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan,” said the latest editorial of the CPM mouthpiece People’s Democracy. ",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/21/NIA-knocks-on-CMO-s-doors.html

Cipla set to launch repurposed drug Favipiravir for COVID-19: CSIR, 27-Jul-2020,,"New Delhi: An off-patent anti-viral Favipiravir has been originally discovered by Fuji, Japan has shown promise in clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 patients, especially the mild and the moderate patients. It is an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API). An active ingredient is the ingredient in a pharmaceutical drug or pesticide that is biologically active. CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) has developed a cost- effective process using locally available chemicals to synthesize Favipiravir and transferred the technology to Cipla Limited. The pharma industry buys very advanced drug intermediates also called as Key Starting Materials (KSM) from China or some other countries. After doing one or two synthetic operations and these are made into final products. “We make KSM ourselves starting from chemicals manufactured locally, that brings down the cost of these products” said Dr Chandrasekhar. “The technology provided by CSIR-IICT is very efficient and makes it affordable and allows Cipla to make large quantities of the product within a short span of time” said Dr Chandrasekhar. DG-CSIR, Dr Shekhar C Mande said that CSIR is working with industry in developing quick solutions and products for mitigation of COVID-19 and this partnership with Cipla is an example of how CSIR is committed in bringing repurposed drugs on a fast track. “We are taking up some clinical trials for repurposing of some other drugs too, that will take some time” told Dr Chandrasekhar.

“Dividing Saints into Dalit or Savarna will only weaken the Society”: Champat Rai, 06-Aug-2020,,"Shri Champat Rai - Gen Secretary, Sri Ram Teerth Kshetra Nayas New Delhi: Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) general secretary Shri Milind Parande on July 30 said that Shri Ram spread the message of social harmony and empowerment through his own actions. “The water and soil being carried to Ayodhya from thousands of holy rivers and pilgrimage centres and shrines across the country to be part of the reconstruction commencement ceremony of the Temple will showcase the togetherness of the whole of Bharat and stand to enthuse, motivate and orient the people to always uphold and celebrate uncompromising cultural nationalism, integral humanism, national unity, territorial integrity of the nation,” he said. Talking to media persons in Nagpur Shri Parande said the emancipation of Ahilya by Shri Ram, high esteem shown to Shabari Mata and amity with Nishadraj are outstanding illustrations of social harmony. The foundation stone of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple was laid in 1989 in the presence of many revered saints by the lotus-hands of a Scheduled Caste young man Shri Kameshwar Chaupal, who is now a valued Trustee of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust. He pointed out that with great pomp, ceremony and joy, sacred soil from thousands of holy pilgrimage centres and waters of holy rivers are being sent from all over the country for the reconstruction commencement ceremony at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi. Whether it is from Nagpur, the birthplace of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or from the birthplace of Sant Ravidasji in Kashi, Maharshi Valmiki Ashram at Sitamarhi (Bihar), Kachargad in Gondia District of Vidarbha (Maharashtra), Ramrekhadham of Jharkhand, Tantya Bheel’s holy place in Madhya Pradesh, Shri Harmandir Sahib at Amritsar, Mahu, the birthplace of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the Jain Lal Mandir in Delhi or the Valmiki Temple in Delhi, where Mahatma Gandhi lived for 72 days – these are only a few examples. The VHP secretary general called upon all the Ram Bhaktas to sit collectively, as far as possible, from 10.30 a.m. on August 5, 2020 in their respective homes, establishments, Ashrams, temples, etc., to offer worship-Bhajan-Keertan-Smaran-flowers-Aarti to their respective adored deities/divinities and distribute Prasad. They should make all possible arrangements to show live the Ayodhya programme to the society; decorate houses, neighbourhoods, villages, markets, monasteries, Gurudwaras, Ashrams, etc., and light lamps in the evening; Pledge to donate for the temple, as much as possible, for the construction of the temple. Using all means of publicity/promotion/exposure/public relations, the Ram Bhaktas should ensure that this grand programme reaches more and more people of the society. Surely, in all these schemes and programmes, all care should be taken, including wearing of face masks, hand sanitizing, social distancing, etc., to protect one and all from the pandemic of COVID-19 infection, and all government and administrative guidelines in this regard must be followed. VHP central joint general secretary Shri Surendra Jain on August 1 said the reconstruction of Shri Ram temple is a glorious moment. The Hindu society fought continuously for 492 years to undo the debasing the signature superimposed by the foreign invader Babar on the birthplace temple of Shri Ram in Ayodhya. “In the latest mass struggle that started in 1984 CE, 160 million Rambhakts and more than 3 lakh villages of Bharat participated. This struggle continued till the historic verdict of the Supreme Court on November 9, 2019. It was the result of this, cultural freedom struggle that Babar’s outlandish superimposed structure, that disgraced our pride and nationhood, is no longer there, and the resolve to build a stately temple to Shri Ram is going to soon materialise steadily by degrees. He further said pride of nationality is an important motivating element for any country, but due to the politics of divisive appeasement, the definition of nationality of Bharat was confused, a national crisis of identity was being created. Now Bharat’s nationality cannot be linked to any foreign invader.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/6/-Dividing-Saints-into-Dalit-or-Savarna-will-only-weaken-the-Society-Champat-Rai.html
"Maa Sharada Ashtami Puja to be offered at Sharada Peeth in PoJK", 26-Aug-2020,,"Puja will be offered at the famous temple ‘Maa Sharada Peeth’ on the occasion of ‘Maa Sharada Ashtami’ on August 26. Sharada Peeth is one of the three holiest sites of pilgrimage for the people of Jammu and Kashmir, like the Martand Sun Temple and the Amarnath Temple. Sharada Peeth is 150 km away from Muzaffarabad and 130 km from Srinagar, the capital of Jammu & Kashmir. Part of the temple is situated in the POJK and partly in the Indian UT of J & K. The puja will be held at the temple on the Indian side of the border, said Indresh Kumar, senior RSS functionary who served as ‘Prant Pracharak’ of J & K during the heydays of terrorism in the late 80s and early 90s. According to a report by News Bharati, Indresh Kumar said that the puja will be offered under the leadership of Ravindra Pandit, a Kashmiri Pandit. A group of five-six Kashmiri Pandits has already arrived at Tikar via Kupwara, Karan to offer the puja tomorrow. This group will proceed to the Indian side of the border and offer the Puja at the temple while some Muslims from POJK will be reaching the border to carry with them the presents from the Goddess, Indresh Kumar said. This way, the worshipping of Maa Sharada will be completed on the auspicious occasion of Sharada Ashtami, he added. Ravindra Pandit and others will reach Delhi with the Prasad on August 29-30. Indresh Kumar said that he prayed to Maa Sharada to free the Sharada Peeth from the illegal occupation of Pakistan so that rejuvenation of Sharada Peeth could be done to offer ‘darshan’ to all devotees with ease. It is believed that the famous temple of Maa Sharda was built by Kashmir’s powerful King Lalitaditya as a prominent seat of learning of Sanatana Dharma. Temple Sharada is also regarded as one of the Shakti Peeths where body parts of Devi Sati had fallen while being carried by her husband Lord Shiva. Since the Partition, the temple has been deserted.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/26/Maa-Sharada-Ashtami-Puja-to-be-offered-at-Sharada-Peeth-in-PoJK.html
Caliph Erdogan?, 27-Aug-2020,,"During the Independence struggle the seeds of Pan-Islamism were sown among Muslims in India through the Khilafat movement by Ali Brothers and company which led to the partition. By invoking the idea of ‘Caliph’ in the form of Turkey’s President Erdogan, the similar game is being played. The obsession with the concept of Caliph and accepting extra-territorial loyalties on the religious ground are dangerous trends. Turkey is known for anti-India statements especially on Jammu-Kashmir, open support to Pakistan and strategic alliance with China. With abysmal human rights record and baltant use of force against minorities, Turkey along with China poses the greatest threat to the democratic world. The visit of actor Aamir Khan to the Turkey’s first family should be seen in this light #Erdoğan: #Turkey is the only country that can lead the #Muslim world was the Headline in pro-government newspaper, Yeni Şafak, dated October 15, 2018.

They came with Red Flag and the Bloodbath Followed, 20-Oct-2020,,"Observers say that from the Left regime to the present day in West Bengal, there is a gross undemocratic trend of identifying people who are going against the ruling party and verbally intimidating them. In most cases, the intolerance precipitates into violent attacks -Suman Bhattacharyya,  Bengal has become the hotspot of political violence,  Gauri Naskar, a 37-year old housewife, was killed on May 17, 2008. She was killed in Basanti, South 24 Parganas, a remote area in West Bengal close to the Sunderbans. Gauri, the daughter-in-law of Subhas Naskar, the then Irrigation Minister in the Left Front Government. Gauri was killed by a crude bomb hurled at her residence by CPIM goons. Subhas Naskar, belonging to the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), had won the Basanti Legislative Assembly seat in 1982, 1987, 1991, 1996,2001, 2006 and 2011. However, his house had also been attacked by political miscreants patronized by CPIM and Subhas could not save his own daughter-in-law. The following day, Ananda Bazar Patrika, Bengal's most prominent and liberal vernacular daily, carried the news in meticulous detail.  The headline was interesting. ""Attacked in the Style of the Bandits of Sholay: Subhas Naskar's House Burnt Down"", it stated. The description of the attack as it was reported would beat any Bollywood potboiler. The death of Gauri Naskar only proves how CPIM used to control rural Bengal with violence and terror. Even its own allies were not spared. It is ironic but, therefore, not surprising that RSP, a partner of the Left Front, later quit the Left alliance in Kerala and joined the Congress-led UDF.  To understand the tradition of political killings in West Bengal, we must go back to the 1980s, when Jyoti Basu, the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, admitted in a speech in the Legislative Assembly that 86 political workers were reportedly killed during that particular year (1988-89). Of the 86 people killed, 34 were CPIM activists. In 1989, Pradyot Guha, then Youth Congress President in West Bengal, wrote a letter to Rajiv Gandhi. Incidentally, Guha had later served as Personal Secretary of President Pranab Mukherjee. Pradyot Guha recorded in his letter to Rajiv Gandhi that in the first 50 days of 1989 (January-February), 26 political murders had taken place in West Bengal. Guha further noted that of these incidents of murder, 8 alone occurred during the first 19 days of February in Murshidabad. The present President of All India Mahila Congress, Shrimati Sushmita Dev, who happily shares the stage and participates in different protest rallies with the Left leaders, has perhaps forgotten and forgiven the miscreants who, in 1989, had brutally attacked her father, Santosh Mohan Dev. Dev was at that time a Minister in the Central Government. Santosh Mohan Dev had narrowly escaped death at the hands of these political goons in the Behala area of Kolkata. He was visiting the Behala area as a part of the enquiry team to probe into the edible oil (rapeseed) scam which had resulted in the paralysis and death of several Kolkata residents. The death of prominent opposition leaders under mysterious circumstances was also a regular feature during the 1980s when CPM rule in Bengal had reached its peak. The accounts of the deaths of ex-MLA Kashinath Tah of Burdwan and Asamanja Dey of Nadia are still remembered by people with great grief and horror. CPIM dissident leader Gautam Bhattacharyya, who hailed from the North 24 Parganas, had formed the Nagarik Mancha (Citizens' Forum) and challenged his former Party. Bhattacharya was brutally killed under mysterious circumstances. An analysis of the National Crime Bureau Records establishes that from 1999 to 2016, there have been at least 20 political murders each year in West Bengal. However, this was contested by Derek O' Brien, Rajya Sabha leader of Trinamool Congress Party. In 2010, Derek tweeted to say that in 1990 alone CPIM had killed 400 of its political opponents. He also claimed that CPIM killed 40 activists of the opposition during the 2003 Panchayat Elections. By the parameters of political violence and cruelty, West Bengal is much above the national standard. This can also be explained from the data provided by the Election Commission. During the 2014 Lok Sabha election, 16 people were reported to have been killed in the entire country. Of them, 7 were from West Bengal. Before this, during the 2009 Elections, altogether 5315 cases of violation of election rules were registered in the country. of these 5315 cases, a total of 18%, i.e., 963 cases were recorded in Bengal. In 2014, this number was 7787 for the entire country, of which, 931 cases alone, approximately 18% of the total cases were from Bengal. There is also a peculiar trend of poll violence in West Bengal. In other states, most of the violent incidents occur on the day of the election. In the case of West Bengal, however, most of it is post-poll violence where 61% of the total recorded incidents of political violence in the state occurred after the voting was over. An RTI Enquiry lodged by one Shyamal Mitra in 2011 is an interesting pointer to how political killings take place in West Bengal. This RTI case was filed to understand the first five months of the regime of Mamata Banerjee. It was revealed that 27 people were killed in the first five months, and 128 students were injured due to student politics in the state. Of the 27 people killed, only 5 were TMC supporters. During the first five months of the regime of Mamata Banerjee, 586 incidents of political violence erupted in different parts of Bengal. Of these 586 incidents again, 56 violent clashes occurred in an attempt to gain control over educational institutions, in the colleges and universities. If the first five months of the TMC rule had claimed the lives of 27 students, then it appears not very strange that the 2018 Panchayat Elections in the state saw the violent death of more than a hundred political activists. ",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/10/20/They-came-with-Red-Flag-and-the-Bloodbath-Followed.html

"'Mantra to be relevant is to skill, reskill & upskill': Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses nation on World Youth Skills Day", 15-Jul-2020,,"PM Modi in his message to the Digital Skills Conclave held today on the occasion of the World Youth Skills Day and the fifth anniversary of ‘Skill India’ mission, exhorted the youth to skill, reskill and upskill in order to remain relevant in the rapidly changing business environment and market conditions. He congratulated the youth of the country on the occasion and said the world belongs to the youth due to their ability to acquire new skills all the time. PM stated that the Skill India Mission launched five years back on the same day has led to creation of a vast infrastructure for skilling, reskilling and upskilling and enhancing opportunities to access employment both locally and globally. It has led to hundreds of PM Kaushal Kendrasbeing set up across the country and increase in the capacity of the ITI ecosystem. Due to these concerted efforts, more than five crore youth have been skilled in the last five years. Referring to  the portal launched recently for mapping the skilled employees and employers, he stated that this would help the skilled workers, including the migrant workers who have returned to their homes, to access jobs easily and the employers to contact skilled employees at the click of a mouse. He emphasised that the skills of migrant workers would also help in changing the local economy. He described skills as a gift which we can give to ourselves and added that skills are timeless, unique, a treasure trove and a means by which one can not only become employable but also help in leading a satisfying life. He said that a natural attraction to acquire new skills provides new energy and encouragement in one’s life. Skills are not only a means to a livelihood but also a reason to feel lively and energetic in our daily routine. The Prime Minster also brought out the distinction between ‘knowledge’ and ‘skills’ in his address. He illustrated this with an example – that knowing how a cycle runs is ‘knowledge’ while actually being able to ride a cycle was a ‘skill’. It is important for the youth to realize the difference between the two and their different contexts and implications. With an example from carpentry, he explained the nuances between skilling, reskilling and upskilling. He further highlighted the potential of the country to capitalise on the skilling opportunities available in the country. He gave the example of the healthcare sector where Indian skilled manpower can supplement the global demand. He stressed the need to map this demand and align Indian standards with those of other countries. Similarly, he suggested that the Indian youth with a long maritime tradition can contribute as expert sailors to merchant navies across the world due to the growing demand in this sector. The World Youth Skills Day, which is celebrated every year on 15th of July, was celebrated in virtual mode this year. Minister of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Minister of State of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, Shri R.K.Singh, and Group Chairman, Larsen & Toubro Ltd., Shri A.M.Naik addressed the conclave. All stakeholders of the system, including the extensive network of trainees going into lakhs, participated in the conclave.

"Dawn of A New Era of Peace, Progress & Prosperity in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh : A Series of Road & Highway Projects to Give Impetus to Growth", 08-Aug-2020,,"Following is the text of an article by Ashok Tandon, a senior Journalist and a Member of Prasar Bharati Board, titled 'Dawn of A New Era of Peace, Progress & Prosperity in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh : A Series of Road & Highway Projects to give impetus to growth' : ""Dr. Syma Prasad Mookerjee, founder of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (predecessor of the present day Bharatiya Janata Party), sacrificed his life spearheading a nationwide Satyagrah (non-violent agitation) demanding complete integration of the state of Jammu & Kashmir into the Indian Union. Dr. Mookerjee had defied the entry-permit order of the government on the J&K border on May 10, 1953, and courted arrest chanting “Ek desh mein Do Vidhan, Do Pradhan, and Do Nishan Nahin Chalenge “(there can’t be two constitutions, two prime ministers & two flags in one nation). He was taken to Srinagar jail where he died under mysterious circumstances on June 23, 1953. Little would have Dr Mookarjee then realized, that his mission would be accomplished when a second generation party leader from Gujarat will  lead the party to power at the centre with absolute majority of its own. The NDA government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 5, 2019, revoked the special status granted to the state of Jammu & Kashmir under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution enabling people of the state to access all central government programmes and laws including right to reservation for disempowered, right to education and right to information, besides, Minimum Wages Act & Minority Act. The historic Presidential Order nullifying all the provisions of autonomy granted to the state  was followed by another landmark and strategically significant State Reorganisation Act, 2019, dividing the state into two Union Territories – Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. Since then the NDA government, over the last one year, has been grappling with a series of challenges on various fronts, including border security, constructive engagement with international community on the J&K issue and domestic political resistance to converting the state into two Union territories. And then there was stupendous challenge of fast-tracking all round development ensuring peace, prosperity and welfare of the people and providing corruption free governance in all the three regions. The central government converted these challenges into an opportunity to undo the betrayal inflicted upon the people of J&K as well as Ladakh in the name of Article 370 by the family-run political parties who ruled the state for most of the last seven decades. PM’s personal appeal to the youth in the region, particularly the misguided elements in the Kashmir valley,” to be a part of this historic journey and walk together for a greater cause” has shown tangible results on the ground. With both J&K and Ladakh as Union Territories (Jammu & Kashmir not permanently) directly under the centre, the Modi government unfolded an ambitious roadmap of peace and progress ushering in a new era of inclusive development and transparent governance in the entire region. The Team-Modi adopted an integrated approach to build a state-of-the art infrastructure and unleashed a slew of fast-track social welfare and employment generation schemes and programmes, especially among the Small, Medium & Micro Enterprises,(MSME), including cottage, handicraft, handloom and horticulture enterprises, aimed at a comprehensive growth and socio-economic emancipation of the deprived sections of the society in all three distinct regions. Good quality all-weather  roads and national highways enhancing the hitherto lacking inter-region and intra-region connectivity has gone a long way in promoting and creating fresh employment opportunities in the post-bifurcation period. A region-wise performance audit of the promises made, over the last one year, gives a fairly good account although a complete transformation in the landscape of this beautiful region will be on canvas once all the ongoing projects, especially several strategically important national highways, including tunnels in the tough terrains, become operational capable of coping with extreme weather conditions. KASHMIR According to Christopher Snedden, famous Australian researcher & author of several books on Kashmir, the name could have been a shortened form of Kashyap Mir (lake of the sage Kashyapa). And famous Indian Sufi poet and scholar Amir Khusro had described the beauty of Kashmir in the following words : Agar firdaus bar roo-e zameen ast,  Tourism has always been the lifeline of the Kashmir economy and the enhanced infrastructure is proving to be a key to its success promoting exports from the valley as well. The Road Transport & Highways ministry, with its arms like the NHAI and NHIDCL in concert with the BRO and the  state PWD  are currently engaged in completing a series of projects which will give impetus to growth and help the start ups in establishing producer companies with focus on further development of  sericulture, cold water fisheries, woodwork, cricket bats, saffron, handicrafts, and horticulture produce. The ongoing projects include Srinagar-Jammu-Lakhanpur highway; the Qazigund-Banihal tunnel and Srinagar ring road. Beautiful city of temples, earlier known as Jambupura, was the capital of Raja Jambu Lochan, the brother of Bahu Lochan, who built Bahu Fort on the bank of river Tawi. The brothers are believed to be descendents of Lord Rama. Jammu with rapidly growing rail and road connectivity, including the Jammu ring road, is getting a  huge boost to its economy with flourishing religious tourism and  star ups in businesses like wood grain work, mills, basmati rice trade, rice mills, carpets, electronic items and electric goods. LADAKH Also known as Ladvags, The land of High Passes and, Maryul of Ngari (lowland of Ngari), has its strategic sensitivity. The region has been a victim of step motherly treatment from the ruling elite in the Kashmir valley. The Modi government decision to make Ladakh a separate Union Territory has heralded dawn of peace, progress & prosperity for the peace loving people of the region and correction in regional imbalance in matters of development and economic growth. Ladakh is witnessing an unprecedented boost to the infrastructure development with all-weather roads and highway network coming up in a big way in difficult terrains and strategic locations. Domestic and international tourism promotion has been given a big push in Ladakh. Sky seems to be the limit of central financial packages to Ladakh resulting in a phenomenal growth in its farm-based economy through enhanced agriculture and livestock activities. An augmented irrigation facility for horticulture and cash crops has improved productivity putting additional money in farmers’ pocket. Last but not the least, the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the state into two union territories has given the local communities in all three regions greater sense of participation in public discourse. It is discernible with the youth in the valley joining security forces and civil services and excelling in the field of education and sports. Today there is greater awareness about women rights and girls education in Kashmir as well as in Ladakh. People are coming forward to join hands with local administration in isolating anti-social elements and exposing Pakistan-sponsored attempts at radicalisation of youth.""",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/8/-Dawn-of-A-New-Era-of-Peace-Progress-Prosperity-in-Jammu-Kashmir-and-Ladakh-A-Series-of-Road-Highway-Projects-to-Give-Impetus-to-Growth.html

They are trying to provide not only rainfall and river level forecast but also location specific forecast of inundation. There are pilot efforts underway to also use innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence to improve locations specific forecast, for which States should provide necessary information to these agencies and timely disseminate the warnings to local communities. He mentioned that investment should be increased in localised early warning system so that people in a particular area can be provided with timely warning in case of any threatening situation such as breach of river embankment, inundation level, lightning etc. Prime Minister also emphasised that in view of COVID situation, while undertaking rescue efforts, States must ensure that people follow all health precautions such as wearing of face mask, hand sanitization and maintain adequate physical distance and relief materials must include provision for hand washing/ sanitizing and face masks for the affected people. In this regard, special provisions should be made for elderly people, pregnant women and people with co-morbidity. PM further conveyed that States should ensure that all development and infrastructure projects must be built with resilience to withstand local disasters and to help in reducing consequential losses. Chief Ministers of Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala and Home Minister of Karnataka gave update on the flood situation, rescue efforts made in their respective States.

It aims at facilitating collateral free working capital loans upto Rs 10,000 of 1 year tenure, to about 50 lakh street vendors in the urban areas, including those from the surrounding peri-urban/ rural areas, to resume their businesses post COVID-19 lockdown. Incentives in the form of interest subsidy @ 7% per annum on regular repayment of loan, cashback upto Rs 1,200 per annum on undertaking prescribed digital transactions and eligibility for enhanced next tranche of loan have also been provided. PM SVANidhi Scheme envisages bringing ‘Banks at the door steps’ of these ‘nano-entrepreneurs’ by engaging the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and the Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs) as lending institutions in addition to Scheduled Commercial Banks - Public & Private, Regional Rural Banks, Cooperative Banks, SHG Banks etc. The onboarding of the vendors on digital payment platforms is a very important component to build the credit profile of the vendors to help them become part of the formal urban economy. Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) is the implementation partner for the scheme. A graded guarantee cover is provided, on portfolio basis, to these lending institutions through Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) to encourage lending to street vendors. The street vendors mostly operate their businesses on very thin margins. The micro-credit support under the scheme is expected to provide not only major relief to such vendors but also help them climb the economic ladder.

"India marches ahead with “Atmanirbhar Bharat”", 14-Aug-2020,,"As part of its continued efforts towards progressively augmenting and strengthening the medical infrastructure across the country, various policy decisions have been taken regularly. The Centre has been leading the graded, pre-emptive, proactive and collaborative response and management of COVID-19, along with the State/UT governments. There was a global shortage experienced for all kinds of medical equipment including N95 masks, PPE kits, ventilators etc. Most of the products were not being manufactured in the country in the beginning of the pandemic, as many of the necessary components were to be procured from other countries. The rising global demand due to the pandemic resulted in their scarce availability in the foreign markets. Turning the pandemic into an opportunity to develop its domestic market for the production of medical equipment, with the combined efforts of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Ministry of Textiles, Ministry of Pharmaceuticals, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and others, India has hugely ramped up its manufacturing capacity. Given the strengthened domestic production capacity and having met the local requirements for PPEs, the revised notification of the Director-General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in July 2020 (Notification No. 16/2015-20, dated 29th June 2020) permitted export of PPEs. As a result of this relaxation, in July itself, India exported 23 lakh PPEs to five countries. These include the USA, UK, UAE, Senegal and Slovenia. This has substantially aided India to position itself in the global export market of PPEs. The “Make in India’ spirit embedded in the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan has resulted in providing resilience and self-sufficiency to the country for various medical equipment, including PPEs. While the Union Government is supplying PPEs, N95 masks, ventilators, etc., to the State/UT Governments, States are also procuring these items directly. Between March to August 2020, they have obtained 1.40 crore indigenous PPEs from their budgetary resources. During the same period, the Centre has distributed 1.28 cr PPEs to States / UTs / Central Institutions, free of cost.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/14/India-marches-ahead-with-Atmanirbhar-Bharat-.html

BRO constructs 180-feet bailey bridge under three weeks providing connectivity to 20 villages in Uttarakhand, 17-Aug-2020,,"A 180-feet bailey bridge in Jauljibi sector of Pithoragarh district, Uttarakhand less than three weeks despite frequent landslides and heavy rains have been constructed by Border Roads Organisation (BRO). A cloudburst hit the area on July 27, 2020, and a 50-metre span concrete bridge was thoroughly washed out, the nallas and rivers were flooded. This caused a mudflow of tremendous force. There were many casualties also due to landslides, and the road communication was broken. The BRO mobilised its bridging resources and set up to construct the bridge. The biggest challenge was to transport parts to the site from Pithoragarh amidst frequent landslides and heavy rains. The bridge was completed on August 16, 2020. This has led to accessing flood-affected villages and has connected Jauljibi to Munsiyari. The connectivity will bring relief to about 15,000 people in 20 villages. The constructed bridge has resumed road communication of 66-kilometre road starting from Jauljibi to Munsiyari. Ajay Tamta the local MP had expressed his concern about the worst affected isolated villages of Lumti and Mori at 25-kilometre from Jauljibi where maximum deaths had taken place. This bridge will provide essential support in rehabilitating the communities.

"“The COVID pandemic has given us a chance to revisit and structurally re-imagine a robust public health infrastructure for our country"": Dr Harsh Vardhan", 17-Aug-2020,,"Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare presided over the inaugural session of the two-day CII Public Health Conference virtually. Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Member (Health) NITI Aayog Dr Vinod K. Paul also participated digitally. A virtual exhibition on Healthcare and the “CII TB Free Workplaces Campaign” was launched, and the “CII Public Health Report” was released in their presence. Thanking CII for organising this event amidst the COVID pandemic, he reminded the audience that “this pandemic has given us a chance to revisit and structurally re-imagine a robust public health infrastructure for our country.” Citing India’s successful approach in containing and curing this novel health risk, he lauded the country’s capacity to turn government schemes into a broader social movement that saw “the complete eradication of smallpox and polio from a time when India contributed 60% of the global cases of polio.” He expressed hope that “the Prime’s Ministers goal of a tuberculosis free India by 2025 would be similarly achieved” with the help of industry leaders and the CII. Recollecting his experience as the health minister of NCT of Delhi when he organised a campaign to eradicate polio with meagre funds but with the full backing and enthusiasm of prominent leaders of the industry, Dr Harsh Vardhan said that he has been witnessing “the same enthusiasm and commitment in eradicating tuberculosis bacilli from the country.” On the TB Free Workplaces campaign, Dr Harsh Vardhan, that “India with nearly 26.4 lakh Tuberculosis cases continues to have the largest share of the global TB burden. The economic burden of TB is huge in terms of lives, money, and workdays lost as it disproportionately affects the poor who live in unsanitary conditions and are deprived of calories”. He deliberated on the government’s response to this problem by pointing out, “Resource allocation for TB in India has witnessed a fourfold increase in the last five years. The Prime Minister had initiated a great survey for detection of TB cases upon taking office in 2014 itself.” Every patient of TB and even those with multi-drug resistant TB are treated free as the government bears the entire cost while doctors are incentivised to report TB cases, he added. The Union Health Minister expressed confidence that the government’s boost to health infrastructure through Ayushman Bharat scheme would similarly eradicate diseases like Kala-azar and Leprosy and push the Maternal Mortality Rate to near zero. Ashwini Kumar Choubey elaborated how the Prime Minister’s efforts to provide medical care at the grassroots have ushered in “a revolutionary expansion of health infrastructure in the rural areas.” “The intensive use of Telemedicine is evident from the 1.5 lakh consultations already recorded on the-Sanjeevani teleconsultation platform,” he added. Dr Randeep Guleria, Director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences in his capacity as Chairman –CII Public Health Council and Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) were also digitally present on occasion.

"India sets a new landmark, exceeds 3 crore tests", 17-Aug-2020,,"India has set a new landmark of conducting 3 crore tests with consistent and coordinated efforts of the Centre and the State/UT governments. Expanded diagnostic lab network and facilitation for easy testing across the country have given a substantial boost. With 7,31,697 tests conducted in the last 24 hours, India is on its resolved drive to increase its testing capacity to 10 lakh tests daily. Building on this achievement, the Tests Per Million (TPM) have seen a sharp increase to 21,769. While the cumulative testing rose from 1.2 crore on July 14, 2020 to 3 crore on August 16, 2020, the positivity rate has seen a rise from 7.5% to 8.81% in the same period. Although higher number of tests will push the positivity rate initially, but as the Delhi experience has amply shown, it will eventually lower when combined with other measures such as prompt isolation, tracking and timely clinical management. Aggressive testing leads to early identification and isolation of COVID-19 positive cases. This coupled with efficient clinical treatment brings the Fatality Rate down. Thus, enhanced and timely testing is not only keeping the Positivity Rate low but also the Fatality Rate low.

"Exports of agricultural commodities from March to June 2020 increased by 23.24% compared to the corresponding period in 2019", 18-Aug-2020,,"Self-reliant agriculture is critical for the goal of an Atmanirbhar Bharat. For this, agricultural export is significant as besides earning precious foreign exchange for the country, and the exports help farmers/producers/exporters to take advantage of the broader international market and increase their income. Exports have also resulted in increased production in the agriculture sector by increasing area coverage and productivity. As per WTO’s Trade Statistics, the share of India’s agricultural exports and imports in the world agriculture trade in 2017 was 2.27% and 1.90%, respectively. Even during the stressful time of pandemic lockdown, India took care not to disturb the world food supply chain and continued to export. The exports of Agri commodities during March 2020 to June 2020 were Rs. 25552.7 Crore against the export of Rs. 20734.8 Crore during the same period in 2019, showing a sharp increase of 23.24%. The agricultural exports as a percentage of India’s agricultural GDP have increased from 9.4 % in 2017-18 to 9.9 % in 2018-19. While the agricultural imports as a percentage of India’s agricultural GDP have declined from 5.7 % to 4.9 %, indicating exportable surplus and decreased dependence on the import of agricultural products in India. Giant strides have been made in Agri export since independence. In 1950-51, India’s Agri export was about Rs. One hundred forty-nine crores which have risen to the level of Rs. 2.53 lakh crores in 2019-20. There has been a substantial increase in export of almost all the agricultural items in the last 15 years. Still, despite being one of the top producers of agricultural products, India does not figure among the top exporters of agricultural produce. For example, India holds the second rank in the world wheat production but ranks 34th in export. Similarly, despite being world No. 3 in the production of vegetables, the export ranking of India is the only 14th. Same is the case for fruits, where India is the second-largest producer in the world, but the export ranking is 23rd. To reach the ranks of a top exporting nation in Agriculture, commensurate with the production, there is a clear and definite need to take proactive interventions. In view thereof, DAC&FW has prepared a comprehensive action plan/strategy towards the promotion of Agri trade. A detailed exploration of data and issues of pre-production, production, and post-harvest has been undertaken to evolve an end to end approach for developing a holistic strategy. An analysis of product groups and then specific commodities have been done concerning the present status of production & exports, strengths, challenges and after that interventions have been identified after consultations with stakeholders. The twofold approach addresses boosting Agri Export with emphasis on value addition and focussed action plan for Import Substitution. The interventions so identified have been converted into a timed action plan. To mention a few, the Export strategy focuses on the export promotion of fast-evolving niche markets of Wellness food/ Health-conscious food/nutraceuticals; Development of “Brand India” in campaign mode to help penetration into new foreign markets and of new products which automatically translates into higher value realisation;  Gulf countries have been identified as focus destination to increase the market share which is a substantial market for India though presently India caters to only 10-12% share of their total imports. A product-market matrix has been made containing a list of products of strength which could be expanded in new geographies and list of public markets which can be introduced with more new products. It is also noted that Horticulture is a growing sub-sector. India holds 2nd position in the production of fruits and vegetables. It exports 8.23 Lakh MT (LMT) of fruits worth Rs 5,638 crore and 31.92 LMT of vegetables worth Rs 5,679 Crores annually. Grapes occupy the premier position in fresh fruit exports followed by Mango, Pomegranate, Banana, and Oranges. In the fresh vegetable export basket, Onions, Mixed Vegetables, Potatoes, Tomatoes, and Green Chilly are the essential items. However, world trade of fruits and vegetables is US$ 208 billion, and India’s share is minuscule.  There is huge potential to increase export in fruits and vegetables. As such, a specific strategy for export promotion has also been evolved for Fresh Fruits & Vegetables with a particular emphasis on grapes, mango, pomegranate, onion, potato & Cucumber-Gherkin. It is also emphasised that the existing Agri clusters are required to be strengthened and more product clusters to be developed to fulfil the gap of bulk quantity and quality of supplies. A time-bound action plan has also been prepared for import substitution with particular focus upon Edible Oils, Cashew, fruits and spices, thereby making India self –reliant. At the behest of the Department of Agricultural Cooperation & Farmers’ Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture, product-specific Export Promotion Forums have been created to lead agri exports to new heights. Export promotion forums (EPFs) for eight agri & allied products viz.  Grapes, Mango, Banana, Onion, Rice, Nutri-Cereals, Pomegranate and Floriculture, have been constituted under the aegis of Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Department of Commerce. Each Export Promotion Forum shall be having exporters of the related commodity as its members along with official members representing concerned Ministries/Departments of the Central and State Governments. Chairman APEDA shall be the chairman of each of these forums. The forums will meet at least once in every two months, to discuss/ make recommendations on issues about the export of the respective commodity and invite experts etc. to the meeting for interaction, as required. The Forums will continuously monitor and identify/anticipate developments in the external/internal situation about the production and export of their respective commodity and recommend /intervene for taking the necessary policy/ administrative measures. They will be inactive touch with the producers, exporters and other relevant stakeholders of respective commodities and hear their problems, and facilitate, support and provide solutions to them. They will regularly study the market for individual products on a global basis, and identifying opportunities and developments/implications for domestic entities, and disseminate the same expeditiously to domestic producers and exporters. The recommendations of the forum will be placed in the product committee / Authority of APEDA. The Forum will keep in close contact with the concerned organisation of Ministry of Agriculture such as MIDH, Extension, NPPO etc., DGFT, Ministry of Civil Aviation, MoFPI etc. to further the interest of agricultural export.

This is the fifth edition of the annual cleanliness survey of the country. The Prime Minister will also be interacting with select beneficiaries, swachhagrahis and SafaiKarmis under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U), from different parts of the country through video conference. The Prime Minister shall launch the Swachh Survekshan 2020 results dashboard on occasion. Swachh Survekshan 2020 is the World’s largest cleanliness survey which ranked a total of 4,242 cities, 62 Cantonment Boards and 92 Ganga Towns and saw unprecedented participation of 1.87 crore citizens. The government introduced Swachh Survekshan to generate large scale citizen participation in the Mission, along with teaching a spirit of healthy competition among cities towards becoming India’s cleanest cities. MoHUA had conducted Swachh Survekshan 2016 survey for rating 73 major cities in January 2016, followed by Swachh Survekshan 2017 conducted in January-February 2017 for ranking 434 cities. Swachh Survekshan 2018, which, ranked 4,203 cities followed by SS 2019, which not only covered 4,237 cities but was also the first-of-its-kind completely digital survey completed in a record time of 28 days. In Swachh Survekshan 2020, to ensure continuous assessment and sustainability of on-ground performance of cities, the Government had also introduced Swachh Survekshan League, a quarterly cleanliness assessment of cities and towns conducted across three quarters, with 25% weightage integrated into the final Swachh Survekshan results for this year. Swachh Survekshan has caught the imagination of citizens and stakeholders alike and the increasing participation from citizens with every passing year is testimony to how common citizenry has taken complete ownership of the Swachhata of its cities. Swachh Survekshan has today made ‘Swachhata’ a thing of motivation and pride – something to look forward to and aspire for.  While Mysuru had won the award for the Cleanest City of India in the first edition of the survey, Indore has retained the top position for three consecutive years (2017,2018, 2019). The results to be announced on 20 August 2020 will bring the curtains down on the much-anticipated results for the 2020 edition which were delayed owing to the current COVID pandemic. 1.7 crore citizens registered on Swachhata App and over 11 crore impressions on social media. 5.5 lakh sanitary workers linked to social welfare schemes and over 84,000 informal waste pickers integrated into the mainstream. More than 21,000 Garbage Vulnerable Points identified and transformed Another feature of the event will be the bringing together and felicitation of MoHUA’spartner organisations in the SBM-U journey, including United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), Google, etc. Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) has made significant progress in the area of both sanitation and solid waste management. 4,324 Urban ULBs have been declared ODF, 1,319 cities certified ODF+ and 489 cities certified ODF++ as per MoHUA’s sanitation protocols. This has been made possible through the construction of more than 66 lakhs individual household toilets and over 6 lakhs community/ public restrooms, far exceeding the Mission’s targets. Additionally, over 59,900 toilets across 2900+ cities have been made live on Google Maps. In the area of solid waste management, 96% of wards have a complete door-to-door collection. In comparison, 66% of the total waste generated is being processed – a jump of nearly 4 times over 2014 levels of 18% processing. A total of 6 cities (Indore, Ambikapur, Navi Mumbai, Surat, Rajkot and Mysuru) have been rated as 5-star cities, 86 towns as 3-Star and 64 towns as 1-Star, as per MoHUA’s Star Rating Protocol for Garbage Free Cities.

Role of Police Force and Municipalities is Important in Overall Protection of Livelihoods of Street Vendors says Hardeep Singh Puri, 18-Aug-2020,,"Hardeep Singh Puri, Housing and Urban Affairs Minister has urged to Housing and Urban Development Ministers of state governments, Chief secretaries, State Principal Secretaries, DGP’s, Municipal Commissioners, Collectors, District Magistrates and other stakeholders to review PM SVANidhi scheme and sensitise all their subordinates towards the street vendors. “To a marginalised Street Vendor already battling to survive on a day to day basis, overturning his cart or asking for a bribe or any other form of harassment, is diabolically cruel. The Street Vendor is invariably neck-deep in debt already, with the stranglehold of unscrupulous money lenders tightening with the exorbitant rates of interest. Thus, when even a single act of harassment takes place, from the very Government that he looks up to for deliverance, it is nothing but travesty” he added. A serious effort is being made to free the Street Vendors from the vicious cycle of indebtedness. The Ministry is also in the process of preparing a plan to capture the socio-economic profile of all PM SVANidhi beneficiaries to facilitate their access to various government welfare schemes, as per their entitlements, said Hardeep Singh Puri. During the meeting, he emphasised that even in standard times the Street Vendors have a marginalised existence and their plight has been compounded with the Covid-19 pandemic as even this marginalised existence is under threat. He also stressed that the Street Vendors need to be provided with an enabling environment where they have a sense of protection from undue harassment/eviction. He added that all concerned authorities must make sincere efforts towards the achievement of the objective. He further said that the role of the police force and municipalities is essential in the overall protection of livelihoods of street vendors and creating a conducive environment and added that the vendors do not demand much, other than a place where they can vend their articles in a harassment-free environment. “Street vendors constitute up to 2% of the urban population, and they contribute immensely to the informal economy. The minister informed that so far, over 5,70,000 loan applications have been received, out of which over 1,35,000 loans sanctioned and over 37,000 disbursed.  “The scheme should not be just seen from the perspective for extending loans to street vendors, but it should also be seen as a part of an outreach for their comprehensive development and socio-economic upliftment”, he said. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) which has provision for the creation of a pro-vending infrastructure in the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) through the Support to Urban Street Vendors (SUSV) component. The Street Vendors Act, 2014 came into effect from May 2014 for protection of livelihood rights, social security and regulation of urban street vending. Pointing out that the lockdowns in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted the lives and livelihoods of Street Vendors, the minister said that to facilitate the working capital needs of Street Vendors; Government has launched PM SVANidhi, on June 1, 2020, under which the vendors can avail a collateral-free working capital loan of up to Rs. 10,000 and this loan is of 1-year tenure. The scheme envisages bringing ‘Banks at the doorsteps’ of these ‘nano-entrepreneurs’ by engaging the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and the Micro Financing Institutions (MFIs) as lending institutions in addition to Scheduled Commercial Banks - Public & Private, Regional Rural Banks, Cooperative Banks, SHG (Self Help Group) Banks, etc. “A graded guarantee cover is provided, on a portfolio basis, to the lending institutions through Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) to encourage lending to street vendors”. The loan application can be submitted through PM SVANidhi portal or Mobile App. The Scheme targets to help build the credit profile of the street vendors through onboarding on digital payment platforms for integrating them into the formal urban economy. Durga Shanker Mishra, Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban affairs, Ajay Bhalla, Home Secretary and senior officers from all over the country were present in the virtual meeting.

As people try to pick up their lives and livelihoods, the team of TRIFED warriors is continuing in its endeavour to help sustain tribal incomes and livelihoods. Due to the suddenness of the pandemic overtaking our lives and the immediate lockdown, stocks by tribal artisans worth crores had been lying unsold. To ensure that these stocks got sold and all the sales proceeds go to the affected tribal families, TRIFED has launched an aggressive plan to market these unsold goods online (offering substantial discounts) through its Tribes India website and other retail platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart and GeM.

He also wished success and motivated them to excel in all spheres of life. In his address to the NCC Cadets, Raksha Mantri said: “the app will be useful to them in digital learning and overcoming the difficulties posed by COVID-19 due to restrictions on direct physical interactions”. “But if one moves ahead with determination and self-confidence, he or she would be able to clear all hurdles and achieve success”, he added. Rajnath Singh also praised the contribution of more than one lakh NCC Cadets who supported the frontline Corona warriors by executing various tasks in the fight against the pandemic.

The App has been made interactive by including a query option. By using this option, a cadet can post his question related to the training syllabus, and a panel of qualified instructors will answer the same. This App will undoubtedly be a positive step towards automation of NCC training, in line with Digital India vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

This would promote RE merchant capacity addition and help in achieving RE capacity addition targets of the country.” He further added that the GTAM platform would lead to an increase in several participants in the renewable energy sector. It will benefit buyers of RE through competitive prices and transparent and flexible procurement. It will also benefit RE sellers by providing access to the pan- India market. The Government of India’s target of 175 GW RE Capacity by 2022 is driving accelerated renewable penetration pan-India. Green Term, Ahead Market contracts, will allow additional avenues to the RE generators for sale of renewable energy; enable Obligated entities to procure renewable power at competitive prices to meet their Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPO), and provide a platform to environmentally conscious open access consumers and utilities to buy green power.  Key features of GTAM: Transactions through GTAM will be bilateral with clear identification of corresponding buyers and sellers, and there will not be any difficulty in accounting for RPO. GTAM contracts will be segregated into Solar RPO & Non-Solar RPO as RPO targets are also segregated. Further, within the two segments, GTAM contracts will have Green Intraday, Day Ahead Contingency, Daily and Weekly Contracts. Green Intraday Contract & Day Ahead Contingency Contract – Bidding will take place on a 15-minute time-block wise MW basis. Daily & Weekly Contracts – Bidding will take place on an MWh basis. Both buyers and sellers can submit the bid. However, the seller will provide a profile in terms of the 15-minute time block-wise quantity (MW) along with the price (Rs/MWh). After the contract gets executed, scheduling will take place as per the profile. In the case of multiple buyers, the profile will get allocated on a pro-rata basis. Price discovery will take place continuously i.e. price-time priority basis. Subsequently, looking at the market conditions, open auction can be introduced for daily & weekly contracts. Energy scheduled through GTAM contract shall be considered as deemed RPO compliance of the buyer.               (Source: PIB)",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/1/Indian-Power-Market-goes-Green-.html
"CSIR-CMERI develops World’s Largest Solar Tree", 01-Sep-2020,,"CSIR-CMERI has developed the World’s Largest Solar Tree, which is installed at CSIR-CMERI Residential Colony, Durgapur. Prof.(Dr.) Harish Hirani, Director, CSIR-CMERI, while elaborating about the technology stated that “The installed capacity of the Solar Tree is above 11.5 kWp. It has the annual capacity to generate 12,000-14,000 units of Clean and Green Power”. The Solar Tree has been designed in a manner to ensure maximum exposure of each Solar PV Panel to Sunlight and also the creation of the least amount of shadow area beneath. There are a total of 35 Solar PV Panels in each tree with a capacity of 330 wp each. The inclination of the arms holding the Solar PV Panels are flexible and can be adjusted as per requirement, this feature is not available in Roof-Mounted Solar facilities. The energy generation data can be monitored, either real-time or daily. Prof.(Dr.) Harish Hirani explained, “The CSIR-CMERI developed Solar Tree besides being the World’s Largest Solar Tree also has certain customisable features for application at various sites. The Solar Trees were designed in a manner to ensure minimum Shadow Area, thus potentially making these Solar Trees available for widespread usage in Agricultural activities such as High Capacity Pumps, e-Tractors and e-Power Tillers. These Solar Trees can be aligned with Agriculture for substituting price-volatile fossil fuels. Each Solar Tree has the potential to save 10-12 tons of CO2 emissions being released into the atmosphere as Greenhouse Gases when compared with fossil fuel-fired energy generation. Besides, the surplus generated power can be fed into an Energy Grid. This Agricultural Model can provide a consistent economic return and help the farmers counter the effects of the uncertain variations in Agriculture related activities, thus, making farming an Economic and Energy Sustainable practice.” Each Solar Tree will cost Rs 7.5 lakhs, and the interested MSMEs can align their Business Model with the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evem Utthan Mahabhiyan (PM KUSUM) Scheme for farmers, for developing a Renewable Energy based Energy Grid. The solar tree can incorporate IOT based features, i.e. round-the-clock CCTV surveillance in agricultural fields, real-time humidity, wind speed, rainfall prediction and soil analytics sensors.  The CSIR-CMERI developed solar-powered e-Suvidha Kiosks may also be connected to the Solar Trees for real-time access to the vast majority of the agricultural database as well as to the eNAM, i.e. National Agricultural MarketPlace for instant and real-time access to a unified online market. This Solar Tree is a Quantum Leap towards making an Energy Reliant and Carbon Negative India.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/1/CSIR-CMERI-develops-World-s-Largest-Solar-Tree.html

This is not the first time that such an anti-cultural mindset has been put to work in the JNU campus. Earlier before a few months, abusive and anti-religious writings were also painted on the base of the Swami Vivekananda statue near the Administrative block and ‘Savarkar Marg’ signage board too was damaged with a similar mindset to provoke religious feelings. In this regard, ABVP – JNU has sought the immediate repair and replacement of the damaged signboard and also initiate an enquiry at the earliest and find the miscreants responsible for the damage of Swami ‘Vivekananda Marg’ signboard and take disciplinary actions for hurting the cultural sentiments of students and causing damage to public property. Shivam Chaurasia, President ABVP – JNU said, “The damage caused earlier to Swami Vivekananda statue had caused immense hurt of sentiments for hundreds of students. Such troubled mindset to hurt other cultural and religious sentiments should be condemned at all costs. JNU administration must take strict actions against the individual or group who have done the damage to the ‘Vivekananda Marg’ signboard”.

The Great Game of Soul-Harvesting Through Conversions, 10-Jul-2020,,"""It appears that in most of the cases of religious conversion, the allurement is the key ingredient. The Missionaries in India are providing gift, gratification, material benefit as well as allurement of free education in reputed school and better life style. Their main target is the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, who are basically under privileged persons. In civilized society no religious body should be allowed to convert any person or a group of persons on the basis of allurement.” 	(Page No. 250 of EIGHTH REPORT OF VII STATE LAW COMMISSION, UTTAR PRADESH) The observations of the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission referred to above clearly recognize the issue of conversions to Christianity through allurements. As opposed to allurements, on the negative side, “divine displeasure” is put forth to induce people to convert to Christianity. In both cases, evangelists need huge sums of money to implement their conversion agenda. The money comes into the country in the form of foreign contributions from donors, located primarily in USA and Europe.

Researchers develop method to produce biofuel from non-edible waste seeds, 17-Jul-2020,,"New Delhi, Jul 16 “Oils derived from non-edible seeds of plants can be used to produce biofuels, to eliminate the competition between food and fuel”, said Dr Kaustubha Mohanty, Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Guwahati. Plants and trees found in India, such as peela kaner, mahua, gulmohar, neem, rain tree, castor, kusumetc., produce seeds that have oil from which biofuels can be made.  Dr Mohanty and his research team use a heat-chemical route to produce biofuels from these and other such seeds that they painstakingly collect from various parts of the country. “We found that these non-edible seeds had a high amount of oil in them, which was exciting”, said Dr Mohanty.  The researchers designed a low-cost pyrolyzer to obtain biofuel from these oils.  While the yield of biofuel was very encouraging, there were some problems – the biofuel had lower acidity and high oxygen content, which made them unsuitable for use as transportation fuel. To improve the properties of the biofuels derived from non-edible seed oils, the scientists used various catalysts such as calcium oxide, zeolite, etc., during the conversion of seed oil to biofuel.  Both yield and quality improved; the biofuels produced were comparable in properties to regular diesel, except for viscosity. “The higher viscosity of our biofuel is still a problem, but we’ll find a way to overcome this”, says Dr Mohanty. Biofuel is not all they have obtained from these non-edible seeds.  After purification of the oil derived from the seeds, the team was left with valuable chemicals in the discards, which find a plethora of industrial applications. One such remnant they could recover was hexadecanoic acid, which is used in making soaps, various cosmetic products, and release agents. Another was stearic acid that has numerous industrial applications.  “This is truly a waste-to-value operation”, says Dr Mohanty. The team is seeking to understand the chemical mechanisms by which biofuels are produced from these sources and are studying their applicability in engines. The team has also derived bio-oil from a mixture of waste plastics and waste biomass. Single-use nitrile gloves used in lab and medical settings were used for this purpose. “The demand for biofuel is expected to increase in future and it is certainly not sustainable to generate them from food sources” said Dr Mohanty. The results of this study have been published in the journal Bioresource Technology. The research team includes Dr Ranjeet Kumar Mishra, Dr Krushna P. Shadangi, Mithelesh Koul, Gautam Ganeshan and Gourav Chatterjee.

Lessons of 1921, 19-Jul-2020,,"If studied deeply with factual historical documents, it can be understood that Moplah Riot was the anterior form of the modern Jihad Malabar is the territory to the north of Bharathapuzha till Kasargod in the state of Kerala. Historians say that Muslim missionaries came to Kerala along with the Arab traders since 9th century AD. Islamic preachers like Malik Bin Dinar, Sarabh Bin Malik etc. came like this. Even the Zamorin who became rich with foreign trade, had many Muslims in his army. The Zamorin granted Muslim elites even the status given to Hindu aristocrats. Zamorin granted the Muslims not only the position of ‘gun and firearm officer’ (ThokkumVedikkar) of the army but also the status of ‘thuramarakkar’ (sabandarkoya) who had the power to collect sea and land tolls. The Zamorin’s navy was filled with Muslims. In short, the Muslim people of Malabar were a society with power and dignity from ancient times. The Muslim population in North Malabar began to grow as the Arab businessmen started marrying the local Muslim women. In 1498, the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama sailed to the shores of Panthalayani, and a new challenge arose for the Arab merchants. The Zamorin took a generous approach to the Portuguese traders. This angered the Muslim traders and they had clashes with the Portuguese. In Calicut, the Arab Muslims had to engage in fierce trade competition with them. The Arab traders realized that in order to gain the support of indigenous Muslims , they had to change their behaviour, way of life and faith. Thus an attempt was started to Arabize the Muslims of Malabar. The Arabs began to interfere in the political affairs of the country using the native Muslims. This was the situation which led to the confrontation of the fourth Kunjalimarakkar (who was the sea-captain of Zamorin) with Zamorin .",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/19/Lessons-of-1921.html

Great Betrayal: Rajiv Gandhi ‘mulled’ gifting Tawang to China, 07-Sep-2020,,"Vajpayee, Pranab Mukherjee and George Fernandes opposed Cong’s ‘surrenderist policy’. In Beijing, PM Gandhi declared: ‘Border is negotiable’ On August 7, 2008, then Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi had signed a secret memorandum of understanding with Chinese Communist Party to ‘promote exchanges at various levels’. Rahul had signed the pact with Wang Jia Rui, Minister in the international department of the CPC, in the presence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and then Chinese Vice-President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. It is a fact that more than country’s interests, what drove Nehru-Gandhis were their family’s image and political power. The Family continues to share a very cordial relation with the Chinese, even as Beijing continued to pursue policies inimical to Indian interests. Rahul’s father Rajiv Gandhi, as prime minister, had contemplated giving away parts of Arunachal Pradesh, including Tawang, to the Chinese as a trade-off for ‘permanent peace’ on the border. But for strong opposition from Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Pranab Mukherjee and George Fernandes, he might have sealed the deal. In this context, it must be mentioned here that it was Rahul’s great-grandfather, Nehru, who had famously said ‘not a blade of grass grows there’ in response to Chinese occupation of ‘huge chunks’ of Indian territory in Aksai Chin. During discussions with Opposition parties, Rajiv Gandhi tried to drive home that it was in India’s interest to reach a compromise with the Chinese (even at the cost of a few kilometers of land). Moreover, he wanted to bring about a general consensus in the country on his peace plan. In one of the meetings with leaders of opposition parties, he is reported to have said: “The McMahon Line was drawn by a ‘thick pen’ on a small-scale map.” This meant that Rajiv Gandhi was game for border alignment variations, as the thickness of McMahon Line on the map implied lack of ‘firmness and definiteness’ on the ground. Rajiv Gandhi suffered from delusions of grandeur. In his bid to emerge as a global leader, Rajiv visited China in 1988. On his arrival at Beijing on December 19, 1988, Rajiv Gandhi declared: “I have come to renew our old friendship…and border is negotiable.” While China asserts that the border dispute covers Arunachal Pradesh which it claims as Southern Tibet, India has always maintained that the dispute covered the Aksai Chin area. However, the Chinese had sold the idea to Rajiv Gandhi that the border dispute between China and India can be resolved permanently if New Delhi accepts Beijing’s claim over the strategically vital Tawang region in Arunachal Pradesh. The Chinese negotiators had dangled the carrot that if the Indian side took care of Chinese concerns in the eastern sector, the Chinese will respond and address India’s concerns elsewhere. Rajiv Gandhi had almost bitten the bait. Former National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon  who was India’s Special Representative for border talks and held several rounds of talks, in his book, Choices: Inside the Making of India’s Foreign Policy, writes: “In 1985, China specified that the concession it was seeking in the East was Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh.” However, he further writes that this was “something that any government of India would find difficult to accept, as this was a settled area that had sent representatives to every Indian Parliament since 1950”. Further highlighting India’s difficulty in accepting the Chinese demand, Menon writes: “The Indian Supreme Court also held in the Berubari case in 1956 that the government could not cede sovereign territory to another government without a constitutional amendment, though it could make adjustments and rectifications in the boundaries of India.”  Rajiv Gandhi held parleys with leaders of Opposition parties to bring them around to accepting China’s demand. Except for a few Chinese stooges and Communists, Rajiv Gandhi’s pro-China policy found few takers from the opposition side. Pranab Mukherjee, who was expelled from the Congress, had vowed to fight Rajiv Gandhi’s ‘surrenderist policy’ in Arunachal Pradesh. The Janata Party came down heavily on Rajiv Gandhi for casting doubts on the McMahon Line. In unequivocal terms, the Janata Party said: “The border between India and China was not a thick line drawn on small-scale map but a clearly demarcated international frontier, which was transgressed by the Chinese.” BJP’s Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was then a member of the Foreign Affairs Consultative Committee, had made even a more serious allegation. Vajpayee said the External Affairs Minister had cancelled a very crucial meeting of the Committee because the government had prior information that the Chinese had decided to attack India in Arunachal Pradesh. During Vajpayee’s regime, the Chinese were told categorically that the Chinese proposal on Arunachal Pradesh was neither practical nor possible and it wanted China to hand over Aksai Chin to India. Rajiv Gandhi’s plan to build a consensus in favour of his ‘China deal’ fizzled out in the face of public outrage. However, China continued to mount pressure on New Delhi to part with some areas in the east through its retainers and influencers in the pro-China lobby. “…when Kuldeep Nayar was told in Beijing that India must make concessions in the east to settle the border problem, he frankly expressed his fear that no government in Delhi could stay in power if it ever conceded anything in the east,” writes Charan Shandilya, a pro-China lobbyist.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/7/Rajiv-Gandhi-mulled-gifting-Tawang-to-China.html
India defeats China to win a seat in the prestigious UN body The Economic and Social Council, 15-Sep-2020,,"While Afghanistan and India polled 39 and 38 votes respectively, China could only muster 27 votes as the majority required was 28. The defeat is a telling reflection of the poor image of China at UN bodies after its handling of the Corona virus, Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations and the treatment of Uyghur Muslims. India has won a seat at the prestigious Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), a subsidiary body of the UN, by defeating China and has become a member of Commission on Status of Women. Three countries India, Afghanistan and China had contested the elections for a seat in ECOSOC. While Afghanistan and India garned sufficient votes, China failed to get the required votes to be a member of the prestigious body. The seat earmarked for Asia-Pacific states had 54 ballots with 28 being the a majority mark for a seat.

Assam to get Israeli technology for bolstering agricultural sector, 03-Nov-2020,,"NJ Thakuria Guwahati: State chief minister  Sarbananda Sonowal laid the foundation stone of Indo-Israeli centre at   Khetri area in presence of Israeli Ambassador to India, Dr Ron Malka on November 2, 2020. The Rs 10.33 crore project is expected to be a value addition to Dispur’s efforts to double farmers’  income   through   infusion   of   technology in agriculture, agribusiness and food processing, said CM Sonowal. The chief minister highlighted the tremendous growth story of northeast India in the last six years due to the visionary leadership of PM Narendra Modi. Sonowal commented that the region has been taken from periphery to the middle of the country’s growth narrative through substantial improvement in air, road and river connectivity for engaging in trades with south & Southeast Asian nations. He also laid emphasis on Modi’s plan to make the region an organic hub and threw light on the State’s  tourism potential showing interest in working with the Israeli government in generating employment. Sonowal also highlighted the potential  collaborations with Israel   in furthering the   growth  of start-up ecosystem   in  Assam through start-up   exchange   program  and   Israeli   mentorship   of various start-up projects in the State. The Israeli diplomat underlined the growing bond of close friendship between India and Israel in the recent years.  Even in fights against the Covid-19 pandemic, both the countries fought together, commented the diplomat adding that he welcomes Assam into the Indo-Israel partnership dynamics with the centre’s opening. Earlier Dr Malka led an Israeli delegation to call on Sonowal at his official residence and held a wide ranging discussion on various issues. Tarun Gogoi hospitalised: Veteran Congress leader and former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi was  admitted to Guwahati medical college and hospital as he complained of breathing problems on Sunday evening. Gogoi (86) was  released from the government hospital on October 25, where he underwent treatments for two months on Covid-19 aggravated ailments. The State recorded 166 new cases for novel coronavirus infections the last 24 hours.

"Assam opens school-colleges, starts constructing 119 MHS in tea garden areas", 02-Nov-2020,," NJ Thakuria Guwahati:  The government directive informs that the attendance of students will not be enforced and should be purely based on parental consensus. Simultaneously the online mode of education will  continue for students who prefer not to physically attend the classes  in the institutions. Under the guidelines, classes for upper primary, secondary and senior secondary schools for VI, VIII, X and XII standards are scheduled for Monday, Wednesday and Friday. On the other hand, classes for VII, IX and XI standards are to be conducted on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Fixation of batches for students will be done by the concerned institution as well prepare a daily routine chart for all subjects. The first batch of students shall come at 8 am and stay up to 12 Noon whereas the second batch shall arrive at 12.30 pm and stay up to 3.30 pm. One class room should not have more than 20 students at a time. Monthly rapid antigen tests (RAT) of all teachers and other staff members should be conducted regularly. At the same time, thermal temperatures check of all students, teachers, and other staff members will have to be done every day. If anyone tested positive for Covid-19, all in the institution premises have to go for screening. Whenever more positive cases are detected it will be closed for a week. Assam lately reduced the infection rate and maintained the number of active cases below 9,000.  In the last 24 hours, it  recorded 166 new cases for novel coronavirus infections. Presently the State has 8802 active cases as 196781 individuals were discharged from hospitals after medical interventions. It recorded a total of 206517 positive cases where 931 persons died of Covid-19 aggravated ailments till Sunday night. Meanwhile, the State government in Dispur has started working for constructions of 119 model high schools (MHS) in various  tea plantation dominated areas. The foundation laying ceremony for the schools with modern classrooms, teachers' restrooms, separate toilets for divyangs, girls and boys among others were held on Sunday at various districts. CM  Sonowal was present at Mekipur tea garden at Nazira of Sivasagar district in eastern Assam. He  ceremonially launched the construction of proposed schools at Mekipur and Bamunpukhuri tea garden localities. Union minister Rameshwar Teli and State health, finance, etc minister Himanta Biswa Sarma also laid the foundation stones for such schools at Dibrugarh and Biswanath localities hoping a new dawn to the tea plantation families in different parts of the State. Speaking on the occasion, Sonowal commented that the tea community is an integral part of greater Assamese society and the community has contributed immensely to Assam’s socio-cultural development. The community, which has embraced Assam and Assamese as their own and assimilated into Assamese society, must be enabled to reap benefits of equal development, he added. He remarked that earlier governments in Dispur did not take substantial steps for developing the education sector in tea gardens and hence the tea community had lagged behind in social and educational development for all these decades. But since coming to power in 2016, the present BJP led  government worked for equal development of all sections following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s motto of ‘sabka sath, sabka bikash, sabka viswas’. Sonowal spoke about the possibility of setting up colleges in the tea gardens in the coming days. He urged the guardians to motivate their children to take advantage of various schemes launched by the government for education.  He also highlighted schemes like providing 80 MMUs in tea gardens, construction of roads in more than 800 tea gardens, Chah Bagicha Dhan Puraskar Mela, 25 thousand one time financial assistance to tea community youths for self employment, scholarships to meritorious students, providing free rice in the tea gardens etc.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/11/2/Assam-opens-school-colleges.html
Jihadis target Hindu girls in Haryana: More than six cases of love jihad reported in recent past, 04-Nov-2020,,"Satish Handa ‘Islamic Jihad is danger to society’, addressing a press conference Shri Alok Kumar ji International Executive President of Vishav Hindu Parishad said giving examples of recent incidents chopping head of a woman with sharp-edged weapon in a Church at France after shouting slogans ‘Allah Hu Akbar’ followed by another incident at Faridabad in Haryana on October 26, 2020 in which nearly 20 years old girl a B.Com student Nikita Tomar was shot dead outside the college when a youth Tauseef hailing from a political family in Mewat forcing to marry after conversion of religion to Islam since past two years attempted to kidnap her accompanied by his friend Rehan and shot her dead when she refused to accompany him and change her religion in broad daylight in the presence of large number of witnesses. Shri Alok Kumar ji said, such antisocial elements involved in ‘Islamic Jihad’ are dangerous to the entire civil society, power of law, human prestige and women empowerment. He disclosed,  as many as six incidents related to ‘Love Jihad’ have been reported in recent past sometime in Mewat area in Haryana state and demanded strict action against criminals involved in such incidents, besides legal provisions by constituting  ordinance against ‘Love Jihad’ to prevent religious conversion in the name of love and marriage. Meanwhile, State BJP President O.P. Dhankhad pointing at Nikita’s murder said there is no pace for such types of nasty criminal happenings in a decent society, which is similar to a case of honey trap against our daughters. He said, government is going to introduce strict ordinance, laws against such crimes similar to Yogi Adityanath government in U.P mulls ordinance against ‘Love Jihad’. He further added, three members of SIT have been constituted to investigate this case and charge sheet immediately to Fast Track Court to punish killers. Mool Chand father of deceased Nikita Tomar resident of Ballabhgarh told media persons that his daughter was earlier kidnapped by Tauseef on August 2, 2018 allegedly forced to marry her after conversion of her religion to Islam and she was rescued by police and later in a meeting in the presence of police his high profile influential family having political background had assured that such incident will not be repeated and Tauseef violating the agreement, attempted to kidnap her on October 26, 2020 outside her college along with his friend Rehan when Nikita refused to accompany him in his car and convert her religion to Islam and was shot dead in broad daylight in the presence of several witnesses. Two youths took Nitika to the hospital and disclosed that she was alive and succumbed to her bullet injuries soon after reaching hospital. Hindu minorities living under fear and excesses in Mewat, Haryana and are unsafe and continuously migrating to safer places since the past 40 years. Past scenario reveals, the situation turned so grim in past about 25 years when large numbers of Hindu families were forced to leave their houses and shift to other places afraid of forcible marriage to their daughters, conversion of religion to Islam and insecurity to their families especially female members. Information also reveals, out of 431 villages in Mewat in Haryana state there is not a single Hindu family living in 103 villages and handful of families belonging to Hindu communities now residing in 82 villages under the shadow of fear and torture at present as if they are living in mini Pakistan in the state. Information also reveals, since past 25 years hard criminals are ruling in Mewat without any political shelter and such gangs are involved in activities like thefts, automobiles lifting robberies, cybercrimes, cow slaughtering not only in the state but also in other states and police from different states including capital Delhi in-spite of all efforts has been unsuccessful to wipe out such criminals from Mewat so far. Majority of Muslim population in Haryana state is residing in Nuh and Palwal districts and there are hardly limited numbers of Hindu families presently left at Nuh, Punhana, Ferozpur Jhirka and Tawru yet not migrated from the area so far facing terror and repeated incidents of ‘Love Jihad’ in our democratic country. Several social welfare organisations have now come forward to join hands to fight against terror demanding special ordinance against forcible conversion of religion as in the states like Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh banned conversion by force and fraud marriage allurement.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/11/4/Jihadis-target-Hindu-girls-for-love-jihad-.html
"Today’s Demography, Democracy and focus on economy will result in a strong AtmaNirbhar Bharat of tomorrow: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at #MyBharat lecture series", 13-Aug-2020,- VSK Karnataka,"The 15 day lecture series of Disha Bharat yesterday featured Hon. Finance Minister of India Smt Nirmala Sitharaman. She spoke on the topic of ‘India – Today and Tomorrow.’ She addressed the audience through Disha Bharat’s Facebook page. Nirmala Sitharaman said that Demography, Democracy, focus on economy of Bharat in today’s context will help the country to shape up for a stronger Atma Nirbhar Bharat of future. The Minister provided some interesting demographical numbers to support her argument. The average age of Bharat at the moment being at 29 years and China being at 37 and Japan being at 48 was a clear indication that demography would benefit the development she said. She admitted that the onus will be on the Governments to generate jobs for the youth. She also said that there is a mixture of urban and rural masses but the density of the youth is a healthy mix. A number of educated engineers, IT consultants, scientists, doctors and paramedics are contributing in Bharat and outside of the country she said. Nirmala Sitharaman said that the way Bharat was geared up for the pandemic in being assertive, confident and portraying cordial relationship itself is a great indicator of sustained global leadership. From delivering the HCQ to various countries, zero production of PPE kits before pandemic to 5 lakh kits and exporting them only shows the commitment of Bharat, she said. Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) has been something the country is to be proud of for its assistance in responding to the needs of the world. The humility in its response and never being expansionist has helped it take all the countries into confidence she added. Bharat has always stood by law both within and in relationships amongst other countries. The contentious issues like the Triple Talaq, construction of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya have been taken up through the judicial process and it denotes the display of strong democracy. The democracy we have is vibrant, decentralised. The panchayat states have their powers through people, she said. 65% population relying on agriculture have produced the sobriquet to India as ‘food basket’ The production of pulses, cereals, jute, rice, sugarcane, cotton have either been at the highest in the world or closest to its competitors she said. The under utilization of the natural resources hitherto  like the mineral wealth will help make Bharat self reliant in the days to come she said. The country has been spearheading in the Digital India and digital revolution she said. Tele Medicine which became a new norm during pandemic is also rapidly growing and we have succeeded to a great extent. The potential of Bharat being the Dhanwantari could be attributed to the positives of cost and quality. Bharat leading the world as Vishwaguru is what we have envisioned and it is our goal to help succeed it. She called the youth towards filing patents, encouraging and enabling startups, entrepreneurial growth, and moving towards better marketing to obtain GI tags in the fields of agriculture, manufacturing, handicraft, natural and food stuffs. In comparison to competitor countries we stand way below but once the youth makes up its mind we cannot be stopped she said. Concluding her talk she urged youth to acquire the skills with the help of the available technology which would make Bharat Atma Nirbhar. The civilizational advantage Bharat possessed has culturally enriched the world and we will continue to spread peace and goodwill.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launches 'Transparent Taxation - Honoring the Honest' platform, 13-Aug-2020,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi today launched Transparent Taxation - Honoring the Honest' platform. He said it will strengthen the efforts of reforming and simplifying India's tax system. The Prime Minister also unveiled the next phase of direct tax reforms aimed at easing compliance and rewarding honest taxpayers in a bid to rebuild the Indian economy.   Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister said that the new platform will be having faceless assessments, faceless appeal and taxpayer charter. The faceless assessment and taxpayer charter will come into place from today itself, while the faceless appeal is going to be applicable from September 25.  Shri Narendra Modi said, the effort is to make the tax system seamless, painless and faceless. The Prime Minister said, amidst all the reforms introduced by the Centre, the number of people who have filed income tax returns has increased by about two-and-a-half crores in the last 6-7 years. He, however, said , it is also true that in a country of 130 crores and it is still very less. Prime Minister Modi emphasised with faceless assessment, the taxpayer is assured of fair, courteous and rational behaviour. He said,  the income tax department now has to take care of the taxpayer's dignity sensitively and  the department cannot doubt anyone without any basis. Shri Modi said, taxpayers charter is also a big step in the country's development journey.

Becoming 'Atmanirbhar' in Electronics, 16-Jul-2020,- Reapan Tikoo,"‘Made in India’ AJIT Microprocessor created by IIT Bombay in collaboration with Powai Labs showed the way in becoming self-sufficient in top-end electronics. However, there are several measures that need to be taken to ensure that India become truly 'Atmanirbhar' in Electronics. Intellectual Property (IP) generation happen in small groups of bright researchers, who choose the path of uncertainty called entrepreneurship; they  are and will create the Atmanirbhar Bharat; and in Electronics too. This entrepreneurship is different from the mushroomed Unicorn start-up portals; who are based on a successful imported business model, imported capital and are for the large Indian market; and are finally an acquisition target for the domain MNC. The problem Our PSU and research institutes like BEL, HAL, ECIL, DRDO, ISRO, NAL etc  have successfully delivered world-class electronics  systems, which is commendable and make us all proud. What is amiss then? A parallel exercise within each of these entities to build equivalent of each foreign IP/Component used. A potential solution - Identify key technologies e.g. indigenous Processor  IP Core. - Policy impetus e.g. electronics systems used in India are mandated to build System on Chip or ASIC using indigenous IP. - The indigenous electronics IP available in any segment, may be classified as a must-use technology for appropriate products used in India. - Indigenous IP can be used in the implementation of a wide array of devices such as strategic electronics systems, IRNSS/GPS receivers, network routers communications, power electronics, basic mobile phone, energy meters, avionics and all of the electronics systems. - Enhancement of the IP, if needed, can be carried out as specific development projects whenever required by the MNC/vendor  supplier with the local IP partners. This can be joint research and development exercise to meet the benchmarked requirements. This knowledge with MNC and Vendors will improve the indigenous IP. Today our indigenous IP is stuck in a pigeon hole with no global or domestic product incorporating it. The vendors having market access to India, will integrate their supply chain in such a way that  indigenous IP is integrated with the Product they are offering. In Defence purchase it should be made mandatory to incorporate indigenous IP available in respective segments. Integration with the overall products should be funded by offsets. Government must ensure that validated and competitive Indian Technology solutions  and  IPs are guaranteed market share by mandating every electronics system to have it; both for Government procurement or other non-State procurement. Researchers at IIT Bombay in collaboration with Powai Labs have developed the country’s first indigenously designed and fabricated microprocessor AJIT Venture Funding Venture funding isn’t available for technology development or for scaling-up despite SIDBI, IDBI, Electronics Development Fund etc have the said mandate. Sometime back we made a  presentation to a VC; never heard from them. But from newspaper, got to know they had invested thirty million dollars in a portal that was to sell lingerie online to  working women. Tax Benefits Building a sustainable start-up in research and IP generation is one of the most difficult businesses in the world. Chances of failure are high; the first field trials of product can fail and iterative incorporation of improvement till it succeeds can be time- and fund-consuming; this needs policy support from the government. Bharat remains a market and destination for cheap labour in the absence of our own industrial research capability. None of our chronic problems will be solved by outsiders, more so in strategic sector. In 2016 NITI Aayog, for promotion of Industrial R&D, recommended the following: 1) Renewed, reintroduction of Section 80-IB (8A) of the Income Tax Act. (Tax break to non-service and non-manufacturing; only  IP generating companies) 2) 10% Income Tax on revenue  to be given from date of filing of the patent (today it is from the date of granting) 3) 0% GST on selling and buying of indigenous IP.

Alibaba's Jack Ma summoned by Gurugram court for censoring content unfavourable to China and spreading fake news in India to 'cause social and political turmoil' through his company's apps, 29-Jul-2020,,"A Gurugram court has summoned Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma over it's former Indian employee's charges that he was wrongfully fired after objecting to censorship and fake news on company apps like UC Browser and UC News,  The Reuters report says that as per the court filings dated July 20, a former employee of Alibaba’s UC Web, Pushpandra Singh Parmar, has sued the company for wrongfully firing him after he questioned the censorship of news and content unfavourable to China on its apps. Parmar has also charged that the company's app like UC Browser and UC News showcased false news “to cause social and political turmoil” in India. Pushpandra Singh Parmar worked as an associate director at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017 when he was fired. He alleges that he was fired as he objected to the censorship and fake news. As per Reuters, he is seeking $268,000 in damages. Based on Parmar's complaint, the district court in Gurugram has issued summons for Alibaba, Jack Ma and about a dozen individuals or company units, asking them to appear in court or through a lawyer on July 29, reports Reuters as per the documents it has seen. The judge has also sought written responses from the company and its executives within 30 days, according to the summons. UC India has refused to comment on the ongoing litigation but has siad that it has been ""“unwavering in its commitment to the India market and the welfare of its local employees, and its policies are in compliance with local laws"". Alibaba representatives did not respond to requests for comment from the Chinese company or on behalf of Jack Ma. India had banned 59 apps which posed security threat to the country and consumers in June and last week further banned 47 apps which were mirror apps of those which were already banned. It has been known for long that Chinese apps censor content unfavourable to the Chinese Government as was done in apps like Tik Tok. Such apps also allowed Hinduphobic content to thrive on their platforms but any content seen as against China was removed immediately. Pushpandra Singh Parmar's charges give credence to the fact that China was censoring any content not in its favor throught is companies and apps across the world. However, this is not the first instance when a former employee of a Chinese company has come forward with claims of censorship and fake news. In May, a lady employee of a Chinese app company Helo had quit after she was unable to bear the demands from the company to censor content unfavourable to China but was asked not to do anything about news which was not in India's interests.

"Indian scribes dying of Covid-19, JFA expresses anguish", 21-Oct-2020,,"Guwahati: As India has lost nearly 50 working journalists to the new-found virus infection, Journalists’ Forum Assam (JFA) repeated its appeal to every media person to be careful and cautious while reporting the pandemic from the ground. JFA president Rupam Barua and secretary Nava Thakuria, while terming the journalists as corona-warriors along with the practising doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, police personnel, etc., expressed shock at the higher stake of loss compared to worldwide media corona-casualties of around 400. The robust Indian media family lost at least twelve journalists to corona-complications within September. Ludhiana based veteran journalist Ashwani Kapoor (70), who worked for highly circulated newspaper Punjab Kesari, succumbed to Covid-19 at a private hospital on September 29. Guwahati based news presenter in All India Radio Golap Saikia (52) died with corona-infections on September 26 at a city-based private hospital. Patna’s senior journalist Arun Kumar Verma (68), who was associated with various Prasar Bharti outlets died during Covid-19 treatment on September 22. Indore journalist Manoj Binwal (55), who was associated with Hindi newspaper Prajatantra, died of the virus infection while undergoing treatment on September 20. A day back, Agra’s journalist Ami Adhar Nidar (50), who worked for widely circulated Dainik Jagran, passed away with the infection. Jammu based scribe Anil Srivastava (68), who was associated with United News of India, succumbed to Covid-19 on September 18 at a government-run hospital. Same day Jabalpur’s journalist Harish Choubey (60), who worked for popular Hindi newspaper Dainik Bhaskar, expired with the coronavirus infection. Aurangabad based journalist Rahul Dolare (49) died on September 14 at a government hospital. The same day, Chennai’s popular journalist-actor Florent C Pereira (67) died of Covid-19. Punjab’s Abohar based journalist Naresh Bajaj (57), who was associated with SachKahoon newspaper, succumbed to the virus complications on September 10. Ravinder Kumar (30) from Himachal Pradesh, who worked for Dainik Jagran, died of the virus infection on September 9. Assam’s Udalguri based newspaper correspondent Dhaneswar Rabha (35) died at Guwahati medical college hospital on September 6. Rabha is the first scribe in northeast India to succumb to Covid-19 complications. Next day, Barak valley’s senior journalist Ashim Dutta (65) passed away at Silchar medical college hospital. Months back, Dhanbad’s journalist Sanjiv Sinha, Gorakhpur’s photojournalist Rajiv Ketan, Mumbai’s senior film-journalist Shyam Sarma, Nellore’s scribe Narayanam Seshacharyulu, Pune’s television reporter Pandurang Raikar, Kanpur’s television journalist Neelanshu Shukla, Patiala’s photojournalist Jai Deep, Tirupati’s television reporter Madhusudan Reddy and video journalist M Parthasarathy succumbed to the virus infections.

Kolkata’s photojournalist Ronny Roy became the first scribe in India to lose his battle against the virus infection. Expressing concern over hundreds of Guwahati-based media persons contracting the virus, the JFA also appeals to media group managements to come clean on their employees’ corona health status as part of their social responsibility. The forum added that while news channels and newspapers continue identifying other Covid-19 patients, and they collectively remain silent when their employees turn positive (except a few infected scribes made personal revelations in social media).",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/10/21/Indian-scribes-dying-of-Covid-19-JFA-expresses-anguish.html
Death of Noted Criminal in Luxury Apartment in Kolkata points the finger at TMC Leadership, 21-Oct-2020,,"Suman Bhattacharyya The accidental death of a noted criminal, Abdul Hossain, alias Sentia, in a luxury apartment owned by a TrinaMool Congress leader sparked controversy in Kolkata. The incident occurred on October 17, Saturday night. Abdul Hossain alias Sentia was a criminal from Bhadreswar area in Hooghly district. Sentia is reported to have been absconding with a record of at least eighteen cases, including those of murder, extortion and robbery. The residents of the area and other apartment owners alleged that Hossain and his accomplices had organised a party in the apartment owned by an influential TMC leader from Malda. The gang had also invited a few sex workers for the party they had organised at the Paikpara condominium in north Kolkata. Eventually, a drunken brawl broke out in the party, and the chaos led the neighbours to call the police. When officers from the local Chitpur police station arrived at the spot, Hossain and his associates tried to lock the apartment from inside to prevent the police from entering it. Apprehending an unexpected arrest, Hossain tried to flee from the fourth storey apartment by jumping into the cornice with the help of a window curtain. A drunken Hossain fell off the cornice and was injured. He was declared dead when he was brought to the nearest R G Kar Hospital by police. The luxury apartment where Sentia and his accomplices were partying that night belongs to Payel Khatun, a Zilla Parishad member and In-Charge of the Health Department in Malda, North Bengal. Her husband, Mohammad Yasin, is known as a powerful leader in Malda district. Yasin had also won the 2013 Panchayat Election as an independent candidate. He was earlier with the CPIM. He switched loyalties in 2013 and emerged as a TMC leader. Reports say Mamata Banerjee had herself cautioned the leaders from Malda to control Yasin, but he developed to be very popular in the youth wing of TMC. Yasin also has 12 criminal cases registered against his name at the Ratua police station in Malda. But the number of cases, his criminal record of imprisonment and his notorious image did not pose any hindrance to his becoming the District Secretary of the ruling party. But now, Abdul Hossain alias Sentia's taking shelter in Yasin's north Kolkata apartment in Paikpara and his subsequent death has triggered a sharp reaction from the opposition parties and created massive embarrassment for the TMC leadership.  Although Yasin claimed that he was out of the station on Saturday and neither he nor his wife had any idea how the miscreants had broken into their apartment, neither the police nor the neighbours are convinced with his version of the story. This incident only proves how criminals are operating freely in the districts of West Bengal. It also points the finger at how the TMC bigwigs in the state directly patronise lumens.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/10/21/Death-of-Noted-Criminal-in-Luxury-Apartment-in-Kolkata-points-the-finger-at-TMC-Leadership.html

'Shiv Sena follows the Congress Path of Appeasement; succumbs to the pressure of Raza Academy', 28-Oct-2020,,"Devidas Deshpande  The late Balasaheb Thackeray had a favourite refrain in his speeches and editorials - ""A convert is more fanatic."" Just look at the current government in Maharashtra, and you will see this in practice. A party changed its colours after the assembly elections and came to power, but its government has to tread by surrendering at every step lest its new boss is offended. Its zeal for appeasement is matched to the one recently converted. Just a couple days after Shiv Sena chief and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray chided the BJP for its insistence on opening temples and claimed to have inherited a true Hindutva ideology, it was put in a tight spot with the Raza Academy raising its head yet again. Yes, the same notorious Raza Academy! This time, the organisation has begged the international Muslim clerics to issue a fatwa against the French President Macron. The Raza Academy is hardly known for any good. It is little more than a gang of rioters, and its claim to the bad name was for going berserk in Azad Maidan in Mumbai and vandalising martyr's memorial as well as attacking women police. In July this year, the Raza Academy opposed the release of ""Muhammad: The Messenger of God"", a 2015 movie directed by Iranian director Mazid Mazidi. Interestingly enough, the movie was from Iran, a proclaimed Islamic country, its director is Muslim, and the viewers were Muslims. The movie was to be released on online platforms.  And yet, a class of people in India developed hurt-burn because of it. So the protests broke out, and the tone for the protest was set by this outfit. The rude shock came from the Uddhav Thackeray-led government who, in his almost one-year tenure, has set records of appeasement of the extremists. The State's  Home Minister Anil  Deshmukh immediately supported the demand and made a written recommendation to the Central Government. ""The film is likely to create religious tension and could lead to law and order problems in the country,"" Anil Deshmukh said. The Maharashtra Cyber Department also sent a separate letter to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology seeking a halt to the streaming of the film. Obviously enough, Dawn Cinema, which was to release the movie, retracted and fundamentalists had one more trophy in their showcase. The point to be noted here is that when Raza Academy carried out it was worst rioting in Mumbai in 2012, the Home Minister belonged to NCP (late R. R. Patil), and today, Deshmukh is repeating the same feat. But how can one blame him? His senior, CM Thackeray, himself sails in that direction. Shiv Sena, which was carrying the flag of Hindutva on its shoulders till yesterday was suddenly possessed by secularism last year and joined the Congress-NCP camp. From then on, its journey is only on the downhill path. It indulged in many secular somersaults, from saying 'the gods have left the field' when temples were closed in Covid-19 time or starting the monthly honorarium for Qazis. The CM, who asked Hindus to celebrate their all festivals at home, keeping a distance and without any inconvenience, was seen begging to Muslims to celebrate the Bakri Eid at home ""only if possible"". The same Raza Academy had taken Muslim women to the streets in Nagpada in Mumbai in January against the CAA. The Mumbai Police repeatedly requested to withdraw their agitation, but these women didn't budge. Clearly, it intended to create unrest on the lines of Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. So what did CM Thackeray do then? Instead of stopping the protesters, he met Raza Academy officials at a function! The history of those, with whom Shiv Sena is hobnobbing or rather is trailing behind them, is replete with such incidents. But what about the Shiv Sena? Late Balasaheb spent his life arousing the self-respect of Hindus and opposing the minority appeasement. He was so ardent that he used to say ""If you have Dawood, we have Arun Gawli."" The world came to a standstill during the pandemic. During this period, Hindus celebrated all their festivals strictly following all the rules. On the contrary, all the rules of the government curfew were openly violated in Ramadan. Police and the administration were reduced to being mere spectators. The police were attacked in places like Malegaon. And Uddhav Thackeray, the son, disciple and political heir of same Balasaheb Thackeray, is forced to beg in front of an utterly nuisance making organisation? The Marathi pride, which Thackeray and his coterie never tire of invoking, is summarised in a sentence 'We will break, but not bend'. The present rulers are ready to bend and break also! The latest missive of Raza Academy targeting French President is another mark of this fallibility.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/10/28/-Shiv-Sena-follows-the-Congress-Path-of-Appeasement-succumbs-to-the-pressure-of-Raza-Academy-.html

A Positive Attitude toward NEET -Need of the Hour in Tamil Nadu, 20-Oct-2020,-G.Nataraja Perumal,"The Nation feels very proud of the remarkable performance by the students of TN state in the NEET. The state’s overall pass percentage at the National level has increased by 8 per cent -a quantum jump when compared to previous years, and its overall pass percentage is 1 per cent above the national average. Government and aided school students have performed exceedingly well, and a rural school student is in the 8th place in the overall National toppers list. The state has underestimated the calibre of our students. A few students have made it to the top without any coaching in private institutions. - An achievement in itself. Middle class and BPL students also figure quite prominently due to their sheer hard work. The new syllabus introduced by the state Govt. has played a very positive, pivotal and crucial role in helping the students achieve better scores and there is no wonder students and teachers from rest of Nation is interested in the state’s new syllabus. The NEET phobia created by some vested interests have fallen by the wayside, Now our students have accepted NEET as a reality as something which has come to stay. NEET has many advantages. One could appear there times. For instance, a student who scored 195 last time has scored 565 this time, previous years students have to sit separately for AIIMS JIPMER APMS etc. This year it is a standard test, and hence students adorning those prestigious seats also loom large. How many benefits at one go! Why should our students commit suicide? Medicine is not the be-all and end-all. We have no right to destroy which we can't create. Life is more sacred and sublime. Let me narrate an interesting incident that happened in the life of late PM Morarji Desai. Then Desai was an ICS topper. One reporter asked Desai what would you do in case you don't get ICS. Pat came to the reply. The world is vast and complete, and I would do something else to eke out a livingInterestingly Desai resigned his prestigious ICS administrative post in the wake of freedom struggle. And lastly, it has become a fashion for our netas in TN to blame a particular community for anything that goes wrong in society. How many MPs and MLAs are there from the branded community from TN.? How many of them are in the state service? At a time when OBCs and SCs have entered into the General category is there any meaning to single out a microscopic minority community for their political vendetta. A few extraordinarily brilliant students from this so-called forward community could make it to the G-Category-their only destination. During the British regime, administrative machinery was very much in the hands of the forward communities, and yet they fought for the ouster of an alien rule. Our TN associations should come out of their political cocoon and view things in their proper perspective. Let them support any political party for their benefits. The associations should pressurize the Government to allocate more funds for more special coaching centres. It is the duty of teachers to create a positive pro NEET atmosphere in the schools. School assemblies could be put to fair use in this regard. No society could raise above the level of its teachers, and there is an unknown teacher behind every action.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/10/20/A-Positive-Attitude-toward-NEET-Need-of-the-Hour-in-Tamil-Nadu.html

"Security Forces intercept car carrying IED, avert Pulwama-like terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir", 28-May-2020,,"Security Forces today averted a major incident of a vehicle-borne IED blast in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.  An improvised explosive device (IED) recovered from a Santro car in Ayengund area of Rajpora in South Kashmir’s Pulwama district was defused by the personnel of the bomb disposal squad this morning.  According to reports, following an intelligence input, a white coloured Santro car was flagged by security forces at a mobile vehicle checkpoint but the driver of the vehicle sped away prompting the security forces to fire few shots at the vehicle which they found abandoned some distance away. “Going a little further the vehicle was abandoned and the driver escaped in the darkness. On closer look, the vehicle was seen to be carrying heavy explosives in a drum on the rear seat,” news agency ANI reported.  The security forces blasted the vehicle and subsequently averted a major catastrophe that could have arisen out of the vehicle-borne IED blast. Addressing a press conference, Inspector General of Police of Kashmir Vijay Kumar said, “Jaish-e-Mohammed has the main role in this. Hizbul Mujahideen assisted them.”  Further, he said that the car may be carrying 40-45 kg of explosives, intended for targeting vehicles of security forces. The police have also summoned expert teams from outside “We had received information that a militant of Jaish-e-Mohammed is going to carry out the operation. So we suspect that Adil (occupant of the car carrying IED) – a Hizbul Mujahideen militant is also in touch with Jaish-e-Mohammed,” Kumar added.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/28/Security-Forces-avert-terror-attack-in-Jammu-and-Kashmir.html

ARZI HUKUMMAT-E-AZAD HIND: 77TH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATION OF THE PROCLAMATION OF AZAD HIND, 26-Oct-2020, -,"Unheralded in the annals of the state, and for the very first time, a solemn befitting memorial was organised in the holiest of the holy land of the Azad Hind Fauj in Imphal, Manipur. Organised by the Azad Hind Fauj Imphal Front, the 77th Anniversary of the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Azad Hind was held on October 21, 2020. A day marked in golden letters in the history of Manipur, Azad Hind Fauj Imphal Front took up the noble initiative to commemorate this day. Azad Hind Fauj Imphal Front is a perfect example of ""Meetings of the Minds""; an association of passionate individuals from varied walks of life bonded by a common desire to create an environment which will bring an awareness of the true history which has been in the obscurity and long overdue to its citizens and the world beyond. The organisation also pledges to carry those stories of supreme sacrifices made by Netaji Subash Chandra Bose and his legendary Azad Hind Fauj far and wide. And even the sacrifices made by the Manipuris in the struggle. Members of the organisation include Patriotic Social activist, Ex-Servicemen, Medical science professionals, Military history researcher, Entrepreneur, Professionals, Media Professionals etc. Yes, without an iota of doubt, India's road to freedom has been a tough one. It was indeed a hard-won fight. Nevertheless, the reflection of that brilliant collective sacrifice made by all the Indians reflects even today in the country. One cannot easily brush aside those supreme sacrifices of Netaji and his Azad Hind Fauj on the road to India's struggle for freedom. It is now widely acknowledged that Britain's insecurity in India was felt even more strongly after the spontaneous public outcry and mutinies by her troops that led her to victory in World War 2. The historic Azad Hind Fauj trials in the Red Fort were the catalysts, and it was the last nail on the coffin of the Empire. Azad Hind Fauj was Raised in Malaya in 1942 by Captain Mohan Singh a former 1/14th Punjab Officer from the prisoners of war collected in Malaya. It crumbled soon after an unsuccessful stint arising out of differences with the Japanese Kikan Office and the Council of Action. Later in 1943, The command was given to Netaji after he arrived in Singapore from Tokyo where he had arrived from Berlin on a U-Boat. Netaji was a well accomplished and a shrewd tactician, and he realised very early that Azad Hind Fauj needed a legitimate Government to function. This led to the famous Proclamation of the Provisional Government of India ""Arzi Hukummat-E- Azad Hind"" on October 21, 1943. The Government was soon granted recognition by many countries. In 1944 it became an integral part of Lt.Gen. Renya Mutaguchi's Operation U-Go, the ambitious Japanese campaign of India. Azad Hind Fauj was fighting alongside the Japanese they marched into India from Burma. 1st Division Azad Hind Fauz based in Burma was led by Col. Zaman Kiani. It was composed of 4 Guerrilla Regiments. The regiments were also known as the Subash, Gandhi, Nehru and the Azad Brigade. The most elite of all the regiment was the Subash Brigade led by Lt.Col. Shah Nawaz. The Brigade arrived along with the Bahadur Group which is an intelligence group along with the southern approach to Imphal valley led by the Japanese 33rd Division. They were hot on the heels after the 17th Indian Light Division, a former adversary since the Sittang Bridge incident. Arriving in Moirang on April 14, 1944 they hoisted the first Indian Tricolour flag on the first liberated soil of India in the town of Moirang at the historic Kangla which was the seat of ancient Royal Power. They were welcomed and assisted by the locals who also enthusiastically enrolled in the Bahadur Group and also the Kikan Office. Some even joined Burma prior to arrival in India. Meanwhile, the Azad Hind Dal went about restoring the public administration in the liberated town of Moirang. The local's volunteers were indispensable to the Japanese and the Azad Hind Fauj as they scouted for food to feed the troops, gathered intelligence reports, reported on the enemy’s activities and also provided labours. For the records, some of the Manipuris retreated to Burma with the Japanese wherein some were captured to be only jailed in Rangoon and released much after the war. Some of them also perished while in the retreat. The other Brigade also had their share of honour especially the Gandhi brigade when a team led by Major Pritam Singh went on an assault to storm the allied airfield at Parallel. On the march, they bumped into a group of Gurkhas who had strongly dugged in. In spite of repeated attacks and casualty mounting on both sides, finally, they retreated to the base camp. Major Pritam and many others were awarded by Netaji himself for a show of conspicuous gallantry. The Nehru Brigade who arrived later was deployed to guard the right flanks of the Japanese. They were also engaged in many fierce clashes for about six weeks. Ultimately with the failure of the Japanese logistics and supply of reinforcements on which Azad Hind Fauj was wholly dependent, the decision to retreat along with the Japanese to Irrawaddy was taken. Whereby it was regrouped again, joined in by fresh troops and mobilised for the second front also. Finally, in the face of the overwhelming Allied push, remnants of Azad Hind Fauj trekked from Rangoon to Bangkok which included the Netaji himself—thus ending Azad Hind Fauj's first outing. It was already a victory for Netaji!. The grand function was graced by Prahlad Singh Patelji, Hon'ble Minister of Culture and Tourism, Government of India as the Chief Guest. A video message by the Minister was also relayed on this occasion. He congratulated the efforts of the Members of the Azad Hind Fauj Imphal Front in remembering and honouring the legacy of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose and his Azad Hind Fauj in Imphal. Maharajkumar Leishemba Sanajaoba, Hon'ble Member of Parliament, (R.S) also graced the function as Guest of Honour. In his speech, he stressed upon the need to understand the correct history devoid of manipulation and concocted narratives. Dr Sinam Rajendra Singh, Chairman of the Front, also spoke about the need of inculcating the spirit of patriotism and sacrifice into the youths of today who will take us forward as a nation.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/10/26/ARZI-HUKUMMAT-E-AZAD-HIND-77TH-ANNIVERSARY-COMMEMORATION-OF-THE-PROCLAMATION-OF-AZAD-HIND.html
"Rashtra Sevika Samiti: An organisation of women, by women, for the Nation", 25-Oct-2020,,"Aparna Singh The journey of the plight of women in India and indeed, across the world was in huge contrast. While ancient India, guided by the philosophy of the Vedas, always regarded women as the source of power and prosperity, the same was not accorded to the women in other parts of the world which was mostly under the influence of Semitic philosophy which regarded women as inferior beings. Under the influence of such Semitic philosophy and the medieval degradation of our society, the plight of women in India also became deplorable. Many socio-cultural movements took up the task of reinstating the old glory to women. Surprisingly, most of such movements were initiated by men. West never had any past to look up to for the respectable place of women in society. They saw exploitation by men as the reason for their pitiable condition, and it was this that gave rise to the male-female dichotomy, which dominates the feminist discourse around the world, including India. Rashtra Sevika Samiti, the world's largest voluntary organisation for women, has remained outside the national discourse on women either out of choice or has been purposely denied its legitimate place. They labelled it as traditional, orthodox and communal which does not stand for gender concerns and reinstates patriarchy. If we dive down the structure, function and the life of the sevikas, one will not find a match for its contemporaneity. As early as the 1930s and 40s a sevika named Bakultai Devkule, a shooter, motorist, swimmer, first sevika and the all India General Secretary (karyavahika) of Rashtra Sevika Samiti, married a non-RSS affiliate, against the wishes of her father. There are numerous examples which defy that Samiti is orthodox and patriarchal. The founder, Vandaneeya Lakshmi Bai Kelkar (Mausiji) herself becoming a widow at a very early stage undertook the task of forming such a vast organisation on October 25, 1936. She, along with another lady named Vandaneeya Saraswati Tai Apte took the organisation across the country. Modernity can be gauged from the fact that sevikas, consisting of married and unmarried women, bow before them every morning in the shakhas. Their contribution to nation-building made them sacred transcending their identities as widows, the mere sight of whom is abhorred by the orthodox elements of the society. Since its inception Samiti has always stood for a strong and determined role of women in nation-building, the feminist movements could not find resonance with this organisation because it was anathema to their basic understanding of the relationship between men and women as binaries. Samiti advocated that they are complementary to each other unlike any other feminist organisation around the world or even within the country, who always saw conflict between them. Samiti is often accused of not upholding the rights of women. It was therefore denied a place in the national discourse. Not playing victims and taking up a more responsible role in nation-building was seen as a dent on the feminist agenda. The three ideals of Samiti for matrutva (motherhood), kartrutva (duty consciousness) and netrutva (leadership) in Jija mata, Ahilyabai and Rani Lakshmi bai respectively are themselves stark examples of denying the gender roles ascribed to women of the contemporary society. Beauvoir, a protagonist of feminism in the western world, was a lady who stood for individual rights and liberty to the extent that she openly displayed her bisexuality and even resorted to child abuse as an expression of female liberty. Taking the inspiration from such proponents for women rights will instil similar ethos in the movement which we are witnessing is the blatant display of women as a commodity. Succumbing to the western idea of feminism and women rights, which was in perpetual competition with men, Indian feminist movement also fell prey to such ideas. Rashtra Sevika Samiti took up the cause of women not considering them as victims but to unlock the potential of the 50 % of the population necessary for nation-building. Labelling it as orthodox is to delegitimise its genuine efforts to make women take a lead role in its endeavour to bring glory to the motherland. It reiterates that economic strength cannot be the sole factor deciding the capability of a person to make a constructive impact on the existing social structure. Economic independence for women to secure their safety post-marriage tussle, as advocated by the feminist is a lesser objective of Samiti. Imagine if every man claimed to be economically dependent only to support himself, what would happen to the existing social system where most women are dependent on men for their economic needs? For Samiti earning a livelihood is not to just become self-dependent but to become dependable for their children, family and particularly for the Nation. When Samiti refers to women as matrushakti it not only refers to a biological mother but the one who sows the seeds of empathy, character, sensitivity, morality and affection among the upcoming as well as contemporary generations. Such tasks are also shouldered by pracharikas (full-time workers) who have chosen to never become biological mothers but are referred to as matrishakti because they instil the moral character and love for the Nation in their sevikas. Samiti has held that women are more capable in many skills not only because mythology or the dharma says so, but it has also been proved in many pieces of research in the modern world. A 2018 research report of Robby Berman in the World Economic Forum found that at any hour of the day women are capable of doing more work than men. Another study published in BMC Psychology found that women are better at multitasking than men. Just like reproduction, the capability of women is not their achievement, but their anatomy, similarly capability to do more work is because of the genetic makeup of the brain. Samiti acknowledges these differences not to look down upon the other gender but as a greater responsibility to contribute towards the family, society and the Nation. Mausi Ji, addressing the annual meeting of all India Rashtra Sevika Samiti held in Mumbai in 1953, said that 'woman is the charioteer of life and man is the hearse (jeevan roopi rath ki saarthi stri hai aur purush rathi hai). She wondered if man represents motion then who has put him into motion? It is the woman who puts the man into motion. Unlike the claims of the feminists that Samiti is a traditional organisation which seeks to uphold Brahmanical rituals, it has always kept its mission of nation-building above everything else. During the annual meeting of all India Rashtra Sevika Samiti held in Wardha in 1961 from November 13-15, the sister in law (wife of Mausiji's husband's elder brother) of Mausiji, who was also her very close associate passed away. She performed the final rites and joined the meeting on the 14th evening and on the 15th, she was there till the finale. She said that 'Person's loyalty is not important but loyalty to element is important (vyakti nishtha nahi tatva nishtha hi mahatvpurn hai). Setting an example before her sevikas that no ritual, no tradition is as important as the task of reinstating Bharat Mata to her past glory. Samiti works pan India and in more than 18 other countries. With more than 2700 shakhas and 475 plus sewa projects Samiti proactively addresses the challenges before the society. During the pandemic, it distributed 4,26,237 gloves, masks and PPE kits, 1,09,696 ration kits and served 4,23,794 food packets. Samiti is aware of the vices existing in the society and vehemently opposes subjugation and oppression of women and also prepares its sevikas to confront and oppose such situations. But it sees the permanent solution not simply in legal protections and perpetual competition with men but in preparing a generation with virtues. Samiti takes up this task on themselves as the first teacher of their child. It is the only organisation by the women, of the women and for the Nation, which talks about its duties first and their rights later.

A vivid description of her first meeting with Swami Vivekananda is given in her book ‘’The Master as I saw him.’’It was a cold afternoon; Swami Vivekananda was explaining  On Swami Vivekananda’’s call, she came to India on 28th January 1898 leaving behind her motherland, family and friends, and established life to serve the people of India in the field of women education, health, and taking up the task of nation-building which she continued till her last breath. On 25 March 1898, she took monastic orders. Swami Vivekananda initiated her into the vow of Brahmacharya and renamed her ‘Nivedita’. Sister Nivedita worked and inspired many Indians from different fields. Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose- At that time, Dr Bose had good status in science in Western Countries. She once said  She was horrified to find that the way in which a great worker could be subjected to such ordeal and petty difficulties because of people who had earnest desire to end his distinction. He even faced racial discrimination to the extent that his college-routine was made as arduous as possible for him so that he could not have the time he needed for his research. And every little thing that happened was made an excuse for irritating correspondence and flagrant misrepresentation. At this stage, Sister Nivedita came and showed the light to Dr JC Bose. In the year 1911 on his birth anniversary, Bose said  In 1901 when everyone stopped publishing Bose Research papers, then she motivated him to write his book and assisted him in writing his scientific papers and books. Being 10 years younger than her, She used to treat him like his child, in many of his letters she referred to him as 'Bairin' (Child), served him as if she were his mother, struggled all the time between work for the country and the national longing.

"UN awards Indian Army officer, Major Suman Gawani with 'UN Military Gender Advocate Award'", 29-May-2020,,"Major Suman Gawani, an Indian Army officer who served as a women peacekeeper with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) in 2019 is being awarded the prestigious “United Nations Military Gender Advocate of the year Award” on 29 May 2020. She will receive the award from the UN Secretary-General Mr Antonio Guterres during an online ceremony being organised at the UN Headquarters, New York on the occasion of International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers.  Major Suman will be receiving this award along with a Brazilian Naval Officer Commander Carla Monteiro de Castro Araujo. Major Suman served as a Military observer in UNMISS from November 2018 to December 2019. While at the mission, she was the principal focal point of contact for gender issues for Military Observers in the mission. The officer encouraged participation in joint military patrols to maintain gender balance, irrespective of the hardships under extreme field conditions. She visited various mission team sites across South Sudan to integrate gender perspective into the planning and military activity in the mission. The officer was selected to attend specialised training on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence (CRSV) at Nairobi and participated in various UN forums to demonstrate how a gender perspective can help in protecting civilians, especially from conflict related sexual violence. Apart from supporting the UNMISS Force initiatives, she also trained the South Sudan government forces on CRSV related aspects. The officer also commanded the UN Peacekeepers Day Parade organised at UNMISS, where she commanded twelve contingents of UNPOL, Military and Civilians.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/29/UN-awards-Indian-Army-officer.html

"Shri Guruji Golwalkar on China (Part III): Friends, Enemies and the Chinese Puzzle", 08-Jun-2020,,"Danger of Personality Cult Some people mistake such frank and friendly warnings to our worthy Prime Minister as indicating want of love and respect for him. They are totally wrong. They seem to identify respect with flattery. We respect the Prime Minister and regard him as a great world figure, but we cannot flatter him, or accept him as infallible. That would not also be fair to him. The Communists and such others shout form housetops that we must all strengthen Nehru's hands. Obviously, it is to flatter him and serve their own ulterior ends. But we say, let us strengthen Nehru's heart. If we do that, we will have automatically strengthened his hands. 'Personality cult' is not only foreign to our culture and tradition but will also do infinite damage to national interests. During the Third Battle of Panipat, at one point Sadashivrao Bhau, the Chief Commander of the Hindu forces, changed his seat from an elephant to a horse. The soldiers, failing to see him, thought him dead, got demoralised and broke up. That was because the person of Sadashivrao was the sole point of inspiration and guidance for the army. On the other hand, for twenty years after Shivaji, Maharashtra did not have any acknowledged leader. Sambhaji had been caught, tortured and murdered. Shahu was in Moghul detention. Rajaram was besieged and isolated in Jinji. But everyone fought the war as if the spirit of Swaraj and Shivaji was reborn in him. It became truly a people's war. After twenty years of fighting with them Aurangzeb died, defeated and broken-hearted. Such is the world of difference between personality cult and dedication to an ideal. The Red Ruse Thirdly, we should be keenly on the alert about the threat from inside our own country. There are, as we know, quite a number of persons amidst us who welcome Chinese aggression. To them the Chinese are the godfathers and the Chinese army is a 'liberation army'. Some of their top men have openly declared that it is Bharat and not China that is the aggressor. Even now the Communists are carrying on virulent propaganda in the border areas that Bhagawan Sri Krishna has descended on earth in the form of Chou EnIai to establish 'Dharmarajya' here! They have also collected funds and told the people to preserve the receipt and show them to Chinese when they come so that they will be recoganised as friends. Such a party has been given a clean chit by our Prime Minister as being cent per cent nationalist! There has been a report that the Communists have tried to indulge in sabotage in Assam. They may try to do the same in various other parts of the country. But strangely enough, they are not kept under strict watch and control. On the other hand, our Government and our people seem to be taken in by their strategy. It is said there is a split in the Communists Party, with pro-Peking and pro-Moscow groups (mind, there is no proBharat group!) bitterly opposed to each other. No one who knows even a bit of the Communist technique will ever believe in that myth. The so-called split is only a trick to dupe the people. Their plan is that one group should bolster up the Prime Minister and his policies so that they can worm themselves into the confidence of the people in general,  and behind that mask the other group in secret should go in for collecting arms and getting trained in guerrilla warfare so that in the course of a few months they may be ready to rise in revolt throughout the country, particularly in Assam and Bengal, to break the administration and thus make it easy for the Chinese to run over the entire country. This is actually being done. Training in guerrilla warfare is being given. The Chinese Puzzle This gives us the clue to the reason behind the sudden and unexpected cease-fire of the Chinese. They have declared cease-fire when they were actually victorious and thus startled the whole world. A great and amazing feat it was, the victor should voluntarily stop fighting and make a very generous gesture of peace! One theory is that the Chinese imagined that the people of this country so fond of quarreling with one another, would continue their quarrels and dissensions as heretofore and that they (Chinese) would be able to exploit them to conquer the country easily. But to their surprise they found that the whole of the country rose as one man with a grim resolve to throw out the aggressor. This was unexpected to the Chinese. Therefore they thought better of it and discontinued their aggression. A second theory is that the Chinese did not expect that arms, ammunitions and other types of military help could be flown to Bharat from America and other friendly countries in so short a while. As a matter of fact, we must deeply appreciate the alacrity and efficiency with which American aid was rushed to us. This also took the Chinese aback, and fearing a smashing counter-attack, they desisted form making any further advance. Some, who are out to praise everything that is Chinese or Russian, say that the Chinese came only to establish their right over the territory, which they claimed to be theirs. They have not accepted the McMohan Line. They say that the actual border is somewhere more to the south. They came up to the border, which they considered to be the right one. In a way they expressed their right and went back. This is giving the Chinese quite an amount of credit. The Deep Game However, one fact has been ignored. Sychronising with the aggression of the Chinese, there was a plan for an uprising by the Communist Party in Bengal. It was to create such wide disturbances that administration would break down, chaos would prevail and the Chinese would be able to take advantage of it to establish themselves from the Himalayas to Calcutta securely. Somehow this plan miscarried. Either because the Communists were not ready, or their hearts failed them at the eleventh hour, or probably because the people became very alert and antagonistic to them, they had no courage to step forward to execute that plan. Whatever the reason, the fact is that they would not, and therefore did not, act up to the expectations of the aggressive Chinese forces. As their plan misfired the Chinese thought they should wait for a more favourable opportunity, and they have therefore discontinued the aggression for the time being. When we piece together this fact with the present strategy of the Communists here, we get a fairly correct and lurid picture  of the volcanic menace that is simmering underneath the apparently calm surface of the present Chinese cease-fire. The Green Danger The other danger spot in our internal set-up is the powerful Pakistani fifth column entrenched in strategic points all over the country. Various types of lethal weapons are being distributed among the Muslims in the border areas. Probably, they feel that this is a golden opportunity for them to revolt, to bring our leaders to their knees and force them to part with another chunk of land as before. As a matter of fact, when the Chinese overran post after post in NEFA area, the Pakistani elements all over the country were jubilant. They used to exclaim, ""You are well served""! They are especially emboldened because of the recent unholy Pak-China alliance. When the people and even the Government officers were vacating Tejpur and other areas, the Muslims alone stayed there saying that a secret understanding had been reached between China and Pakistan to partition Assam between themselves-the northern portion going to China and the southern portion to Pakistan - and that therefore they were safe. They were fully roused to the frenzy of 1946-47. They raised slogans of 'Pakistan Zindabad', and 'Smiling we got Pakistan, fighting we shall take Hindusthan'. They pillaged and looted the vacated Hindu houses and shops. So, it is the duty of all citizens including the well-meaning Muslims to specially beware that such fifth column elements are held in check right from the start and do not get a chance to disturb internal peace and order which is an absolute prerequisite for building up our defences. The one guiding principle while dealing with all such subversive elements is to treat them on par with the enemy and put them down with an iron hand. There is an extremely instructive episode in the Mahabharata. When King Janamejaya performs the Sarpayaga (serpent sacrifice ) in revenge for the killing of his father Parikshit by the serpent Takshaka, Takshaka flees and seeks asylum with Indra. Then Janamejaya proceeds to bring down Indra also along with Takshaka into all-consuming fire saying Lsanzk; r{kdk; Lokgk Such unsparing measures alone will put fear into the hearts of potential agents and allies of the enemy and make them behave as loyal citizens. Appeasement Whets Appetite Then we have to consider, especially in the present context, our relations with the neighbouring countries. Here we have to be aware of one factor. When we are in a difficult situation like this, Pakistan-which according to Pandit Nehru was born in hatred and bloodshed-is likely to bully us. And there is also a possibility that our leaders may  give more and more in a bid to placate it and make a compromise over Kashmir. Raja and Jayaprakash Narayan have even canvassed that peace must be made with Pakistan at all costs, even by parting with Kashmir if necessary, so as to forge a joint front against China. But will it solve the problem? What does the past history of those elements tell us? Countless were the experiments made to 'win their hearts' by patting their backs and showering concessions upon them. Finally we even gave them parts of our motherland. Even then they were not satisfied. They attacked Kashmir. To please them we gave onethird of Kashmir. We also gave them the waters of canals built at our cost. Over and above it, we gave them nearly eighty-five crores of rupees. But in return, what have they given us? Under the terms of Partition, they had to give compensation for the immovable property that the Hindus had left behind. The property amounted to hundreds of crores of rupees. But so far we have not received even a single pie. We have been giving everything they demand. But have we ever succeeded in getting anything from them? If we ask them to keep quiet by giving them more and more, will they stop? If now we give Kashmir, then they may ask for Assam and then for Bengal. The more we give the more their appetite gets whetted. So this one-way traffic must stop. The only basis for talks with Pakistan is to tell them, ""China is a common danger for both Bharat and Pakistan. If China succeeds neither of us will remain free. Therefore let us stand shoulder to shoulder to face this common powerful foe."" This must be the only basis for talks. If we begin to appease them, there will be no end. Recognise Friends That brings us to our relations with the Western countries. There is nothing wrong with the policy of non-alignment as such. On the contrary, our folly has been that we were not strictly non-aligned but were oriented more towards the Communist bloc. When England and France attacked Egypt over the Suez affair, we were the first to denounce them in the strongest possible terms. But when China butchered Tibet we did not utter a word of protest. And when Russian tanks rolled into Hungary and crushed its freedom revolt we even tried to justify that act. Had we remained truly non-aligned and pointed out our common devotion to democracy, the West would have looked upon us as a dependable friend. After all, when we were in trouble we looked to them and they rushed to our help. Russia, in spite of all its protestations of friendship for us, sent us the four MIG planes scheduled to be sent earlier, several months after the critical hour had passed. Stranger still, the planes were sent by ship and not by air! So far we have not heard about their having been flown at all. We do not know whether the Government calls these developments as alignment or non-alignment. Let us hope the Government will take an objective view of the problem and not allow high-sounding slogans and shibboleths to come in the way of arming our nation to the teeth. We must get arms from wherever we can have them. If Germany could buy guns in England on the eve of the First World War and France could sell tanks to Germany on the eve of the Second World War and all the countries opposed to Germany including Russia could receive American military aid during that war, why should we fight shy of taking arms aid from willing countries, whichever they may be? Fortify Trusted Sentinels There is an important link on our Northern frontier which we must strengthen. And that is Nepal. Form times immemorial Nepal has been identified with our national way of life. It is a sovereign State, and we are happy over this fact. It is small in size and it is our duty to see that it is not crushed out of existence. Under pressure from a much bigger power, China, Nepal has accepted in its moments of weakness the proposal for the Lhasa - Kathmandu Road. It is our duty to see that the independence and sovereignty of Nepal are preserved. Both of us are facing a common danger. We must respect Nepal's sovereignty and create confidence in its mind about our bona fides. Its rebels have sought shelter in our territory. This has been causing much heart-burning in Nepal. It has given rise to a virulent anti-Bharat propaganda in that State. We must restrain these rebels and reestablish the ties of traditional friendship. Let the defence of our sacred motherland be the first criterion of all our policies-internal and external. For that, if it becomes necessary to cross our frontiers let us do it without the least hesitation. Today the Dalai Lama is in our midst. Tibetans are still offering stiff resistance to Chinese forces in their country. This is a factor in our favour for the liberation of Tibet. Let the Dalai Lama set up his own émigré Government and declare the independence of Tibet. Let us give him all necessary support in carrying on the struggle for his country's freedom. Without a free and friendly Tibet, all our Northern defences become merely mockery. But our Prime Minister says that such a step would be 'manifest nonsense' we cannot understand why he should be opposed to such a noble cause-a cause in support of the independence of a down-trodden people and which is a pre-eminent requisite for our national security. In fact, our late revered President Dr. Rajendra Prasad had said that we cannot hope to protect our frontiers unless we carry the war into the enemy's territory and for that, liberation of Tibet is the first military step.

Shri Guruji Golwalkar on China (Part IV): Real threat— Crisis of character, 10-Jun-2020,,"2. THE RIGHT PHILOSOPHY IN order that we may mobilise our entire internal resources and liquidate all types of internal forces of subversion and fight till the enemy is completely vanquished and the yellow scourge erased from the face of the earth, the one great and inexhaustible storehouse of power that we have to build up is the sterling national character of the people. Without that, any amount of external aid and equipment will be of no avail. The Real Threat We know that in the defeat of the democratic forces in China and victory of the Communist rebels, one of the most decisive factors was the 'characterlessness' of the democratic forces. America tried its best to protect that democracy. They helped it with millions of dollars and huge quantities of arms and ammunition of the latest type to equip the army so that it may deal effectively with the Communist revolt. But history tells us that even officers in the army, for the paltry gain of a few chips, sold the American arms to the rebels, with the result that they became very well equipped and the nationalist army was defeated. Nearer home, there are countless such instances of characterlessness. To cite an instance, it is widely known that Pakistanis are hatching a conspiracy in Assam. Many Pakistanis from East Bengal have infiltrated and are still infiltrating into Assam. They have settled down there. This is a conspiracy to make Assam a Muslim-majority area and later join it to Pakistan. But our Government is not willing to face this fact. It has not opened its eyes even though we have been sounding a note of alarm from as far back as 1950. Now it asks, ""How to recognise those Pakistanis?"" Some persons in Assam came forward and prepared a list of all the Pakistanis who had illegally entered in recent years, with their names, addresses, etc., and submitted it to the Government. The Government appointed an officer to go into that list and report his findings. He made enquiries. His report was: ""This list is all false. Only a very few have come from Pakistan."" Why did he report in that way? It came to be known later that he had taken a huge bribe. Lord Attlee, the reputed Labour leader of England, has said in an article that the Government machinery in our country has become corrupt to the core. It is in such countries, he says, that the Communists succeed in subversion. He had asked a prominent person of one of the Asian countries whether there was any threat of Communist subversion in their country, to which that person gave the significant reply, ""Our administration is not corrupt and therefore we have no such fear."" This warning, coming from an eminent statesman of a mature nation, must make us pause and ponder over this fatal internal corrosion. The Basic Malady Thus, crisis of character is a very serious affair. We have to grapple with it, not merely by words or by criticising others but by going to its very roots. Mere criticism will take us nowhere. If we call X, Y, or Z names, how it is going to correct our behaviour? On the contrary, it will give us an additional bad quality of calling others names. How then can we eradicate this demon of immorality from ourselves? It is well known that a person becomes immoral and corrupt to the extent his selfishness gets the upper in his life. The greater the selfishness, the more a person is prone to take recourse to unseemly methods for fulfilling his self-interest. It a man is unselfish, he will never go in for evil and his character will never suffer. He will be an honest man. Today selfishness has grown. Every man wants something more than what he gets. He does not care whether the way in which he gets it is good or bad. Often it is bad, and therefore there is crisis of character. So we have to control the selfishness of man. This is an extremely difficult job. Constituted as we are, some little selfishness is bound to be there. We are not all sadhus. We have not given up our families, wearing only a koupinam. It is not possible for us. So far as the whole society is concerned, that will not also be conducive to welfare of the society. A little selfishness will remain, to maintain our body and our family and to give them a minimum of happiness compatible with modern times. Let us not, therefore, think ill of any person who desires to lead an ordinarily comfortable life. But then that is the limit. If a person goes beyond that and indulges in selfishness to the detriment of the interests of the people as a whole, then certainly it is reprehensible. Morality from Top Downwards How to control self-interest from running amuck? Suppose we advise all people and give them lectures, will it do? Will Sadachar Samitis and mass pledges in public achieve that miracle? Mere lectures on morality and pledges have never corrected people's morals. Further, many persons who lecture on morality and administer pledges are such that we should not look into THEIR lives! Once I met a Sadhu. He told me that he was giving lectures to the clerks and other lower staff in Government offices on 'character', on how not to be corrupt and so on. I said, ""But, how will you succeed in your mission? You advise a chaprasi who may be taking a bribe of a few paise. Can you not realise that the chaprasi is a poor man unable even to feed all members of his family twice a day? If in that condition, he stoops to taking a little bribe, we can only pity him, though of course we cannot justify his action. So go higher up, lecture to those at the top. See if they can be corrected."" Then the Sadhu said, ""But the higher-ups are good!"" I said, ""I shall give you an example. There is a gentleman in the galaxy of our political leaders, who is adored and loved by the country. Once on the eve of the last elections, he was invited to a city to be presented with a purse for the purpose of elections. A number of big businessmen and industrialists had formed a committee and collected a big sum of money. At a grand function, with all those speeches extolling the person and the party, they offered him the purse. He got up to reply. He said, ""I know that all these people that have assembled here are indulging in black-marketing and the money they have offered me is born out of sin. It is sinful even to touch it. I feel that all such should be flogged publicly and even hanged!' All this he spoke in a very high moral tone, but quietly pocketed the purse and went away!"" Fortunately, the Sadhu also knew this incident. Then I told him, ""Go to such high-up and correct them first."" If the top men are morally upright, then morality will trickle down to the lowest stratum of society and general good character will be the result. You cannot build character from the bottom to top. It has always to be built up at the top first. On the other hand, physical comforts have to be provided starting from the bottom. Feed those who are at the lowest rung of the ladder of our social life, who are physically working hard day and night and leading an existence, which is certainly an insult to the dignity of the society. Let the people at the top go without a meal, I don't mind. But that is how society should be rebuilt and revitalised - physical needs from the bottom upwards and morality form the top downwards. The Living Ideal It is a matter of common experience that character and morality are wanting even in the very high strata of our national life. Those in the higher strata of life are intelligent and educated. They know what is morality and what is immorality. They can even deliver excellent sermons on the subject. Then, what are we going to achieve merely by advising such persons? Can we improve the moral standards of our people by taking recourse to legislation? Take the case of Prohibition. It is in force in many states. But in all those States, illicit distillation has become a flourishing cottage industry! Hence, mere legislation is a useless instrument for bettering the morals. In fact, there is only one way by which selfishness can be restrained. Give the man an ideal to work for, to live for and die for. Then that person, in his devotion to that ideal, will be able to control the pulls of his self-interest and build up a better character. There is no other way. Give the people an ideal, high and holy, an ideal, which naturally resonates in their hearts, throbs in their blood and which has been with them for generations. Then even the ordinary man in the street will be able to feel the rise of devotion and character in him. Such an inspiring ideal is the realisation of the glory and greatness of our scared Hindu Rashtra. ""I am a child of this great Hindu nation. For generations, my great forefathers have striven to make this the greatest and noblest nation - an ideal nation of ideal men - on the face of the earth. I, too, will live and strive for the same goal."" - This is the natural impulse that we have inherited. We feel it in our blood. If this natural sublime urge is roused then our people will be able to rise above their selfish pulls and manifest chaste national character in their day-to-day life. The Vision that Inspires Even in the present times of national crisis we cannot afford to ignore this content of idealism. Let us not forgot that it was on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, when war-drums were beating, trumpets were blowing and Arjuna was standing in the centre of the two armies, that Sri Krishna taught him the eternal and inspiring message of selfless action in the cause of dharma and spurred him to matchless valour and victory. It is only when a hero is inspired with the vision of an ideal that he will be able to put forth the best in him. He should be clear in his mind about the life values for which he is to fight and die, if need be. Talk of economic plans and industrial glory cannot stir the people to suffer and sacrifice. Dry and disparaging descriptions of our motherland as 'snow-bound', 'unfit for human habitation', 'not a blade of grass growing there', etc., will only kill the spirit of the people who will then see no difference even if such a piece of land is occupied by the enemy. So it is absolutely essential that the eternal and inspiring call of devotion to our holy motherland and our national ideals is engraved in the heart of every son of this soil. All our valiant freedom fighters in the past and in modern times were inspired with the living vision of Hindu Rashtra. That was the only effective rallying cry to rouse our masses to action from one corner of the country to the other. And whenever that vision was blurred or lost sight of, the people too relapsed into inactivity and servility. The lesson of the 1857 War of Independence is before us. The great leaders of that revolution, at the very first stroke, captured Delhi and released the Moghul Badshah who had become a mere tool in the hands of the British. They reinstated him on the throne as the free Emperor and declared him the leader of the War of Independence in a bid to mobilise the support of those sections of the people who still owed loyalty to the Delhi throne. But this step made the Hindu masses suspect that the atrocious Moghul rule, which was smashed by the heroic efforts and sacrifices of Guru Govind Singh, Chhatrasal, Shivaji and such others would once again be revived and foisted on them. And that, they felt, would be a greater tragedy than the English rule. The Hindu mind, which was inspired with the hope of Hindu Swaraj looking at the great Hindu generals like Nanasaheb Peshwa, Tatya Tope, Rani Lakshmibai and Rana Kunvar Singh lost its urge to fight. Historians say that this was one of the decisive factors, which ultimately led to the collapse of that revolution.It is only when the people are inspired with this age-old national vision that it is possible to make them rise to heights of selflessness, sacrifice and heroism and to forge them into a single living national entity from one end of the land to the other and build up an unassailable national strength. And when we do that, we will be able to humble not one but ten Chinas! (The Bunch of Thoughts- Part Three - The Path To Glory: XXIV.

"‘Indian Army has world's most experienced mountain troops’, says Chinese military expert: Indian Army wins a rare public complement from China", 10-Jun-2020,,"Amid the ongoing Indo-Tibetan border standoff, a Chinese military expert publicly complimented the Indian Army. ""At present, the world’s largest and experienced country with plateau and mountain troops is neither the US, Russia, nor any European powerhouse, but India,"" Huang Guozhi, senior editor of Modern Weaponry magazine, wrote in an article published by China’s thepaper.cn on Tuesday. It is perhaps the first time a Chinese military expert publicly complimented the strength and military capabilities of Indian Amry. His remarks came close on the heels of the decision taken by Indian and Chinese armies to undertake a ‘symbolic disengagement’ in a few areas in eastern Ladakh. ""With more than 200,000 troops in 12 divisions, the Indian mountain force is the largest mountain fighting force in the world,"" Huang wrote. Huang said that since the 1970s, the Indian military has established and expanded the size and personnel of the mountain troops on a large-scale, and also plans to create a mountain strike force of more than 50,000 troops. ""Mountaineering is an essential skill for almost every member of the Indian mountain army. To this end, India even recruited a large number of professional mountaineers and amateur mountaineers from the private sector,"" he said. Referring to the Indian Army’s presence in the Siachen glacier, he said ""the Indian Army has set up hundreds of outposts in the Siachen Glacier area with an altitude of more than 5,000 metres, with 6,000 to 7,000 fighters stationed. The highest post has reached 6,749 metres."" The Indian military is equipped with a large number of weapons adapted to the highland and mountain operating environment through procurement and domestic research and development, he said. The Indian military has also spent heavily on advanced heavy equipment from the United States, including the M777, the world’s lightest 155mm towed howitzer, and the Chinook heavy transport helicopter that lifts the gun, to boost its fire support and anti-armour capabilities"", he said. ""In addition, there are many conflicts and differences between the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force. This has also led the Indian Army to decide to equip its own US-made AH-64E Longbow Apache attack helicopters instead of relying entirely on airfield support from the air force,"" Huang wrote. In this environment, combatants must not only do their own warm protection, but also prevent acute altitude sickness such as cerebral pulmonary edema due to low pressure and hypoxia, he said.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/10/Indian-Army-wins-a-rare-public-complement-from-China.html

Shri Guruji Golwalkar on China (Part V): Fate of Unilateral Goodness, 17-Jun-2020,,"“It is here that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh comes up to play the role of creating the necessary will and competence in our people to turn this difficulty into an opportunity. The Sangh has been straining every nerve and fibre to rouse and mobilise jan-shakti by imparting life giving ideals, qualities and character required for a powerful, positive and perennial national life. We are confident that every Swayamsevak of our organisation will be found in the forefront when the hour for people’s action and sacrifice comes.” (The Bunch of Thoughts- Part Three - The Path To Glory: XXIV. Fight to Win*) *In the wake of Chinese invasion in October 1962 Dreamers Wake Up One more serious impediment that we have to clear up is our mental reservation regarding building up of national strength. The very idea of strength was an anathema to our leaders all these days. The mental climate of our leadership was somehow averse to it. They believed entirely in pious platitudes. Even recently some of our responsible leaders indulged in talks of unilateral disarmament which would be nothing but unilateral suicide! At least since 1954 our leaders have been aware, on their own admission, of the fact of the naked aggression of the Chinese. But they continued to live in the dreamland of Panchsheel. During these eight years we could have equipped ourselves very well and made our defences impregnable. But today we are having a small army, fewer arms and still fewer bullets. Production of bombers, fighter planes, tanks, military transport, etc., was totally neglected. There is not one anti-aircraft gun of sufficient range with us. And we are talking of disarmament! How can we disarm when we have no arms at all? We have read in papers that our ordnance factories manufactured coffee crushers and plastic bags. They also produced a truck with a capacity less than that of even an ordinary truck and called it 'Shaktiman'! And the very first sample of 'Shaktiman' collapsed at its first trial! But now it seems our leaders have learnt a lesson at the cost of so many precious lives of our soldiers. Our Prime Minsiter has frankly confessed that China awakened us to a world of reality form a dreamland of our own creation. At one place he gave expression to his new realisation saying, ""We cannot survive without strength. If it comes to that we will fight even with lathis."" And our Home Minister Sri Lal Bahadur Shastri said, "" We will no more be caught napping."" Which only means that they were napping till now! It is some solace that, though late, they have realised the truth that strength alone counts in this world of conflict and that the world understands only the language of strength. Let us pray to God that their present realisation will not be shortlived. As a matter of fact this is an elementary principle of life which our ancients had realised long, long ago. Manusmriti says: n.ML; fg Hk;kr~ loZa txr~ Hkksxk; dYirsA (It is out of the fear of sceptre -a symbol of authority- that society is sustained.)  And they lived in the light of that truth. Though they preached and practised the highest philosophy of human brotherhood, they never ignored the hard realities of the world in which they had to live and move. Sometimes we hear our leaders say that traditionally we have always been a peace-loving and non-violent people. True, but it was not the peace at the cost of honour, it was not the peace of the grave. In fact, passive submission to belligerence was looked down upon as a sign of unmanliness. We had in the past set up standards of valour and heroism and produced some of the greatest generals and conquerors the world has ever known, who fought and killed and carried on fierce battles relentlessly to establish peace wherein dharma reigned, supreme. Philosophy of Suicide We are really amazed that even at this critical hour, there are eminent personalities who continue to think and preach in the same old strain. Even now they argue, ""We are a people of peace and non-violence. If the Chinese come, we will only stand before them as a peace army. What will they do? After all, it requires two to fight. If we do not fight, then with whom will they fight?"" A good argument indeed, especially appealing to those who have not sufficient guts to fight! It is true that two are required for a fight. But it is not necessary that both should be fighters. It is sufficient if one strikes and the other receives the blow! And again, if we remain peaceful and behave well with others, is it a necessary corollary that others also will behave likewise with us? Is it our experience of the world? Fate of Unilateral Goodness Take our own example. When Islam was first born, the King of Gujrat came to know from traders that a new faith had arisen in Arabia. He felt curious to know what it was and asked his traders to bring some of the learned men of that faith in order to know more about it. Some moulvis came to Gujrat. Our pandits held discussions with them. They found that it was a faith that inspired man to pray to God, though it had no philosophy as such. Therefore the pandits and the King said, ""it does not matter if you have no philosophy. If you can guide the individual to pray to God; your faith is good. We wish well of it. Let all the people of Arabia go Godward on account of this great new faith that your founder Pygamber has propagated."" That is, we respected the faith, the moulvis and the founder. We did not say that it was some trash, which had to be destroyed. No Hindu will ever say that. There is the other instance. In the South, in the kingdom of Madurai, there was an Arab Muslim merchant. As he was a person of good character and great qualities, the king made him his minister. Even today, some Muslims have been made ministers. But that is done with an eye on the Muslim vote! That was not the consideration before the king, because he did not depend upon the votes of Muslims to bolster him up! The Muslim gentleman was made a minister only out of respect for qualities of the man. We have thus behaved with Muslims with respect, love and fraternal affection. But, how did they reciprocate? Their history of the past one thousand two hundred years, full of incidents of destruction, depredation and all sorts of barbaric atrocities, is there before our eyes. The present-day large Muslim population in our country is one of the results of the fatal devastation that they wrought all over the land. Not only the broken monuments but these pieces of a broken society also are equally an evidence of their vandalism. What has our good behaviour towards the Muslim faith and the Muslim people brought us? Nothing but desecration of our holy places and enslavement of our people. Face the Reality Take the case of China. For more than two thousand years, ever since the Buddhist influence entered China, there has been a regular intercourse of learned men and a sort of fraternisation. Our modern leaders also picked up the same thread, as it were, and raised the slogan of ""Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai'. They pursued this policy even to the extent of renouncing our moral responsibility in the case of Tibet. We renounced it, and in a way offered Tibet on a platter to the all-grabbing China. We have really proved faithless to Tibet. In fact, China did not turn faithless to us, as there was never any question of putting our faith in them. On the other hand, it is we who have betrayed the trust that Tibet had reposed in us. We committed a great sin. God only knows how we can atone for it! We committed this sin only to call China 'Bhai'. To this extent we made fraternisation with China. How has it responded to our fraternal attitude? By attacking our frontiers! Such a one-sided good behaviour in this matter-of fact world does not seem to yield any fruits. Let us now turn to the character of the Chinese and see whether it is true that they will not cut us down as grass if we just keep quiet, as some say. When the present Communist Government came to power in China, they massacred many people in order to eliminate opposition to their rule. As reported in those days, the number of people they liquidated was about ninety-six lakhs. Can any man in his senses believe that if a Government, which is headed by people who in order to slake their thirst for power can indulge in the  massacre of their own countrymen to the tune of about one crore, sends its armies into our country, those armies will go back without killing us just because we refuse to fight? We have to realise that in order to meet all such brutal challenges of this world and come out victorious, strength- solid invincible national strength- alone can help us. Sources of Soldier’s Strength In all such grave crises our armies will have to be there in the forefront to bear the burnt cheerfully and courageously. And especially, the incomparable valour and bravery of our soldier on the battlefield fills our heart with confidence, pride and joy. But when such a soldier looks back, what should he see? Should he see a disintegrated and unpatriotic people, all indulging in their own selfishness and scramble for power? If this is what the soldier sees, will he be inspired to fight and lay down his life? Let him see a consolidated and patriotic people behind him. Let him feel the confidence that whatever the army requires, this steel willed and well-organised people from Kashmir to Kanyakumari is ever ready to fulfil it. If men are required, men will be forthcoming. If various other necessary items are to be supplied there, they will come inspite of any hardship that the people may be put to. With the confidence that the whole of the people is backing him, every soldier will feel that his strength, his fortitude and his capability to fight has become hundredfold, and he will come out victorious. Strength Begets Friends It is only when we acquire the strength to stand firm in the face of adversity that friends also will rush to our aid. Why should they help if we ourselves are unfit and not firm enough to stand? Even if they want to help, how and whom should they help? Even now, when we made a feeble attempt to stand on our own legs we got help from so many quarters. Help came from America about whom our leaders rarely said a kind word. Help came from Britain though we had bitterly criticised them over the Suez affair. Help came from West Germany and many other countries. Let us at least now have a word of gratitude for them. A Blessing, but When? In view of so many healthy trends set in motion in our national life by the Chinese invasion, we often hear that it has been a blessing in disguise. It is a fact that foreign aggression affords a golden opportunity for nation to purge itself of corroding tendencies like selfishness, internecine feuds, separatist pulls, etc., and to recast itself into single unified and purified entity. The sense of imminent danger spurs the individuals in the nation to rise above all other petty feelings, to merge their interests in the supreme national good and stand as living limbs of a colossal national personality. But all this can be achieved and made enduring only if we have the will, the wisdom to grasp the great chance offered to us and capacity to profit from it. Without that preparation on our part even the blessing may prove to be a mere shock and waste and nothing more. Once the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, appeared before a beggar, blessed him and asked him to receive a shower of gold. But she told him that the gold would turn into dust if it touched the ground. The beggar eagerly opened his bag holding it with both his hands. The goddess filled the bag with gold sufficient to keep his family in affluence for generations to come. But the beggar was greedy and requested her to put a handful of gold more. The goddess showered one more handful and disappeared. But the bag gave way because of the weight, all the gold fell on the ground and immediately turned to dust! One requires worth and strength even to make use of the blessings of the Almighty. Tending the Roots So also is the case of nations when ‘blessed’ with foreign aggression. It is here that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh comes up to play the role of creating the necessary will and competence in our people to turn this difficulty into an opportunity. The Sangh has been straining every nerve and fibre to rouse and mobilise jan-shakti by imparting life giving ideals, qualities and character required for a powerful, positive and perennial national life. We are confident that every Swayamsevak of our organisation will be found in the forefront when the hour for people’s action and sacrifice comes. At the same time, we do not want to come forward as a group because in times of war there is no necessity of any priesthood of any group or party. It would also be highly improper to parade one’s sacrifices and sufferings. Because to offer one’s all, even his dearest possessions, at the altar of motherland is the first and foremost duty of every son of this soil. And it is that life-spirit that we have been inculcating in the people through the Sangh since its very inception. (The Bunch of Thoughts- Part Three - The Path To Glory: XXIV.

First, China's claim of just 80 thousand COVID19 patients is rubbish. Around 14 million sim-cards are missing since coronavirus pandemic started. Moreover, around more than 100 million migrant workers are not getting enough food to survive. Second, the figure for Chinese un-employment rate of about 6% is a big lie. As per One of the Chinese think tank, the unemployment rate is more than 20%. Xi's regime scrapped this report and fired the team who prepared this. Third, Chinese businesses are frustrated because, on the one hand, Xi's has given target to create more than 9 million jobs and 4-5% GDP growth. However, on the other hand, Xi has destroyed all lucrative markets from Chinese business and industries. Today because coronavirus breakdown, China cancelled around 1200 flights to/from Beijing. There are deep anger and frustration among Chinese people, and even in CCP's power corridors about Xi's in-aptness and negligence in handling the containment of COVID19 and global affairs. The pressure is increasing for removal of XiJinping's protégé and Beijing's party secretary Cai Qi (蔡奇). Because Xi brutally removed almost all Hubei, provincial government after coronavirus pandemic breakdown. Because of this, multiple clashes happened within Hubei government departments and between Hubei and other provinces. Another frustration Xi is facing that India is emerging as an undisputed regional and global leader. This is evident by these several series of events. First, President Trump himself invited PM Modi to join G7, and Trump also proposed to expand G7 to G11 or G12. Second, Secretary of state- Mike Pompeo discussed with Indian foreign minister of India about the restructuring of global supply. Pre-covid19, China used to control up to 75% global supply chain. Furthermore, the US wants to reduce China's share and want to bring it below 40%. Third, even after spending millions of dollars in the Maldives, China could not align the Maldives with its political interest, because recently when Pakistan raised issues against India in Islamic countries meeting the Maldives, and neighbouring countries backed India. China also wants to malign India's friendly and trusted-partner image with the neighbouring countries. As per this strategy, during Dokhlam border standoff, China involved Bhutan, now China is forcing Nepal to start a confrontation with India. Note, in May 2020 Chinese ambassador (in Nepal) met Nepal's PM and his two opponents (all of them from Nepalis' communist party). From there all these anti-India sentiments is artificially planted in Nepal. China will fail again in Nepal. ""Unfortunately in 70th bilateral anniversary year, all these events have clearly set narrative for future, i.e.""India vs China"". Not only trade-deficit but also trust will collapse drastically.

Indian Army Completes Construction Of Bridge Over Galwan River That Was Opposed By China, 20-Jun-2020,,"Border Roads Organisation (BRO) under the supervision of the Indian Army has completed the construction of the bridge over Galwan River in Ladakh that China had objected to. The construction is significant as it comes at a time when Indian Army is engaged in a stand-off with the Chinese expansionist forces in Ladakh. It was in this area that Indian Army had killed more than 43 PLA soldiers while 20 Indian soldiers made the supreme sacrifice in the battle with Chinese forces. Reports say the 60m four-span bridge which is near the Patrolling Point 14 where the clash between Indian and Chinese forces took place earlier this week. The construction of the bridge was completed on Thursday. The Indian Army is working to complete the 255 Km-long strategic Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road including eight bridges and its blacktopping at some of the stretches by the end of this year, reports ANI. The bridge on the Galwan river is on this stretch of the road. The road reduced the travel time between Leh and DBO to six hours from a significantly higher duration earlier. Though the construction of the road was started almost 2 decades ago, Modi government laid special emphasis on it when it came to power in 2014. In the all party meet on 19th June, PM Modi had stressed that primacy was given by his government to border area infrastructure to make our borders more secure. He also reiterated that neither is anyone inside our territory nor is any of our post captured.

"China provoked 'Indian Nationalist Tiger' by engaging in a face-off with Indian Army personnel, say US media", 17-Jun-2020,,"Chinese People Liberation Army has provoked the ""Indian nationalist tiger"" by engaging in a face-off with Indian Army personnel in which 20 soldiers were killed, according to US media. 20 Indian soldiers martyred in the violent clash that took place late evening and night of June 15. The Chinese side has suffered 43 casualties.   ""Beating 20 Indian soldiers to death Monday evening, China's People's Liberation Army has provoked the Indian nationalist tiger,"" Journalist Tom Rogan wrote in an opinion piece in Washington Examiner. Highlighting the importance of the nationalist government in power in India, Rogan said “(We should) not forget that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's power flows from this nationalist base. Shaping a foreign policy vision of India as a global power capable of and willing to defend its interests, Modi has skillfully redirected Indian nationalist sentiments away from their prior obsession with domestic sectarian interests (though this remains a problem) and toward the idea of India as a key international player.” “Considering that both China and India possess nuclear weapons, this concern should not be underestimated,” he added. Over the past two months, the PLA has been increasingly aggressive along the Line of Control, frequently confronting Indian patrols on the assumed Indian side of the border, Rogan noted. Chinese President Xi Jinping has also allowed the PLA to send aggressive officers to engage with more diplomatically minded Indian Army commanders. This is straight out of China's now reflexively imperialist foreign policy strategy and is designed to intimidate India into compromises that favour Beijing. “And while neither side seeks an actual military conflict, the potential for miscalculation is far greater than some assume. PLA forces along the border are particularly emboldened by the relative freedom of action they are afforded from Beijing,” he observed. Rogan said that the United States should stand with India in the border issue with China. ""The world's most populous democratic nation is facing the same Chinese aggression that Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines experience nearly every day in the South China Sea. And it poses an existential threat to the American-led liberal international order,"" he wrote. Meanwhile, the United States has expressed condolences to the families of the 20 martyred soldiers and said that it is monitoring the situation at LAC.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/17/China-provoked-Indian-Nationalist-Tiger-says-US-media.html
"Kashmir: Leaderless terrorists are in dire straits, surrender is the best option", 26-Jun-2020,,"The security forces, especially the Indian Army, are constantly giving messages and statements requesting the local youth to shun the path of terrorism. They also call upon those who have joined in surrendering on the promise of being treated honourably. The local youth should heed these messages since they are to their benefit since they stand no chance once they are caught in the security dragnet. In a new and unique trend, a large number of terrorist hideouts are being busted by security forces based on human intelligence provided by locals. It seems that the terrorists, under the pressure of being caught, are not staying in once place for long. On many occasions they are vacating the hideouts in a tearing hurry, leaving behind warlike stores like Rifle magazines, radio sets, UBGL’s, grenades and also administrative items like food packets, clothes etc. Magazines are being left possibly because there are no rounds to fill them up; UBGL’s are difficult to hide, so they are also being shed. Security experts are of the view that this panic is due to a near-total absence of experienced terrorist leadership on the ground. Since the beginning of this year, reports have been coming in about the decimation of terrorist cadre and, more significantly, terrorist leadership. In January 2020, Lt General KJS Dhillon, the then Corps Commander of Srinagar based Chinar Corps had stated that the Army has wiped out the leadership of Pakistani terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Kashmir even as groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and al-Badr have been completely decimated. At that stage Riyaz Naiko was the only commander left in the indigenous terrorist organisation, Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, now, even he has been killed. The lower rung that was elevated to leadership role has also been neutralised of late. As many as six self-styled “commanders” have been killed in June itself. On June 19, the present General Officer Commanding of Chinar Corps, Lt. General BS Raju, in the presence of J&K Director General of Police (DGP), Dilbag Singh, stated that the security forces have neutralised eight terrorists in the last 24 hours. Please note that this was the time when turmoil over the Galwan incident was at its peak. After that, a steady headcount of terrorists has been reported daily. On June 20, a day after the press conference, a JeM associated foreign terrorist, Tayab Waleed, was killed at Likhdipora, Kulgam. He was known to be an IED expert. Three other local terrorists were also eliminated in a separate encounter on the same day. The total number of terrorists killed in this year has already attained a record threshold of 100 plus, including the most important leadership. In January 2020, Lt General KJS Dhillon, the then Corps Commander of Srinagar based Chinar Corps had stated that the Army has wiped out the leadership of Pakistani terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Kashmir even as groups like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and al-Badr have been completely decimated. At that stage Riyaz Naiko was the only commander left in the indigenous terrorist organisation, Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, now, even he has been killed. The lower rung that was elevated to leadership role has also been neutralised of late. As many as six self-styled “commanders” have been killed in June itself.  Among the stuff being confiscated by security forces are, most abhorrently, sex-related items like condoms, Viagra etc. This indicates that, while being under so much pressure for their very lives, the terrorists are not averse to molestation of local girls. Ever since the cult of terrorism took roots in the region, there have been distressing reports of molestation of women by terrorists, especially those of foreign origin. Once infiltrated into Kashmir, these terrorists, drunk on the power that the AK-47 gave them, threw the ideology of Jihad to the winds and concentrated on leading a good life which primarily included fulfilling their carnal desires. Many forced marriages were leading to the advent of “Half Widows.” Fortunately, that time has been left behind since terrorism has waned considerably. Sadly, even the few remnants seem to be more interested in following the footsteps of their predecessors than concentrating on the cause of so-called Jihad. The time has come for the people of Kashmir to negate the cult of terrorism and violence that these evil people perpetrate. With the Line of Control (LOC) virtually sealed, a well laid out pattern is being followed for recruitment of local terrorists. The lookout is for boys from the middle class to low-income families who are ready to sell their souls for a small amount of money and promises of a bright future in this world beyond. Some are drug addicts and others, in the flush of youth, join to impress their girlfriends. Families should stay vigilant about the well-established propaganda machinery that has been put in place to lure innocent young Kashmir boys. There is always a Burhan Wani or someone else of his ilk being used as poster boys in the propaganda campaign. They are prominent in all Pakistan based social media outlets catering for large Kashmiri youth audiences. There is no element of religiosity and sacrifice visible in the murderous and perfidious acts of terrorists. The sheen given by the media is ridiculous and a blatant spread of disinformation. The time has come for the people of Kashmir to negate the cult of terrorism and violence that the evil people perpetrate. With the Line of Control (LOC) virtually sealed, a well laid out pattern is being followed for recruitment of local terrorists. The lookout is for boys from the middle class to low-income families who are ready to sell their souls for a small amount of money and promises of a bright future in this world beyond. Some are drug addicts and others, in the flush of youth, join to impress their girlfriends.  The new age terrorist in Kashmir can safely be profiled as an indoctrinated local youth who is both ill-trained and ill-equipped. He is given rudimentary instructions, handed over a rifle with some ammunition and let loose. Such ill-trained persons are no match for the highly professional and experienced security forces. On top of it, they lack local support. Even in their localities, there are many ready to see them dead; hence, their life span is very short. Family support, especially from the mothers in Kashmir, becomes more relevant because sons do appreciate and reciprocate their mother’s love, affection and sacrifices. We are many examples of Kashmiri youth excelling in several competitive exams and other fields like sports and making their mothers and families proud. It is these examples that should be emulated. The security forces, especially the Indian Army, are constantly giving messages and statements requesting the local youth to shun the path of terrorism. They also call upon those who have joined in surrendering on the promise of being treated honourably. These messages emanate from the highest offices of the Corps Command and DGP, Police. The local youth should heed these messages since they are to their benefit since they stand no chance once they are caught in the security dragnet. It is hoped that good sense prevails and the small segment that still supports terrorism also s shifts to a path of peace and prosperity as a vast majority of the people already have.

The Border Roads has executed 30 per cent more works in financial year (FY) 2019-20 as compared to FY 2018-19. The BRO has worked incessantly even during the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 without affecting the progress of various projects. Despite unprecedented snowfall, breaking 60 year old record, all strategic passes and roads were cleared this year for traffic about one month before their average yearly opening dates. The Border Roads executed snow clearance works on 149 roads (of 3,965 kilometres) in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. This ensured rapid and early movement of troops and logistics to forward areas. While complimenting the BRO for its achievements, Raksha Mantri exhorted it to continue its work to achieve even greater laurels. The Border Roads has also inducted latest equipment and machines and has introduced modern construction methods after successful trials to expedite works on surfacing with cementations base, use of plastics, geotextiles, etc and various techniques for slope stabilisation. Trials have also been carried out successfully for indigenously produced modular bridges in collaboration with Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Limited (GRSE) under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative.

Nimu is surrounded by the Zanskar range and is on the banks of river Indus. The Prime Minister met the top leadership of the Indian Army and later interacted with personnel of the Army, Air Force and ITBP. Prime Minister paid rich tributes to the valour of our Armed Forces, stating that their courage and devotion to Mother India is unparalleled. He stated that Indians can go about their lives peacefully because they know that our Armed Forces are standing firm, protecting the nation. Prime Minister said that due to the exemplary bravery of the Armed Forces in the recent weeks, the world has taken note of India’s strength. Prime Minister remembered all the proud sons of Mother India who made the supreme sacrifice at the Galwan Valley. He said that those who were martyred belong to all parts of India and epitomize our land’s ethos of bravery. He affirmed that be it Leh-Ladakh, Kargil or the Siachen Glacier, be it the high mountains or the icy cold water that flows in the rivers, these are testimony to the gallantry of India’s Armed Forces. The enemies of India have seen the fire and fury of our forces, said the Prime Minister. He also paid homage to two Matas: to Mother India and to the Mothers of all those brave soldiers and security forces of India who serve India with unparalleled diligence. PM spoke at length about how the virtues of peace, friendship and courage have been a part of India’s culture since time immemorial. He recalled that India has always given a befitting reply to anyone who has tried to disturb the prevailing atmosphere of peace and progress. He affirmed that India is committed to peace and friendship but this commitment to peace should not be seen as India’s weakness. Today India is becoming stronger, be it in naval might, air power, space power and the strength of our army. Modernization of weapons and upgradation of infrastructure has enhanced our defence capabilities multifold. Prime Minister recalled that Indian soldiers had a long history of bravery and competence in global military campaigns, including in the two World Wars. Prime Minister said that the time for expansionism is over. This is the era of development. He recalled that it is this mind set of expansionism that did great harm. He added that in the last few years, several steps have been taken for the wellbeing of India’s forces and furthering India’s security preparedness. This includes ensuring availability of modern weaponry, increased border infrastructure, border area development and expanding the roads network. He further shared that expenditure on border infrastructure has been enhanced three times. Prime Minister also mentioned the efforts to strengthen the national security apparatus and to ensure the well-being of our armed forces. He highlighted recent initiatives of the government such as creation of CDS, construction of a grand National War Memorial, fulfilment of OROP after decades and steps to ensure the well-being of the families of the armed forces personnel. During the interaction, Prime Minister recalled the greatness of Ladakh’s culture as well as the noble teachings of Kushok Bakula Rimpoche. He described Ladakh as a land of sacrifice and a land that has given several patriots.

"Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Zoom among 89 social media apps banned by Indian Army for its soldiers and officers", 09-Jul-2020,,"Close on the heels of the GOI banning 59 apps over national security concerns, Indian Army has banned 89 social media apps for its soldiers and officers. The list of apps banned by Indian Army include a large number of Chinese origin apps and popular social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Tumblr and others. The app list released are categorised as messaging platforms, video hosting, content sharing, web browsers, video and live streaming, utility apps, gaming apps, e-commerce, dating apps, anti-virus, networking, news, health, knowledge, music and blogging/micro blogging apps. TikTok, Tinder, PUBG, Snapchat, OkCupid, UC Browser, Bumble, ShareIt, Xender, Helo, CamScanner, Club Factory, Humgama, Zoom, We Chat, Viber, Hike, etc are among these 89 apps. Indian Army sources say that it has asked its personnel to delete these apps from their smartphones if it has been already installed. The measure was mandated by the Army to plug leakage of sensitive information and security considerations say sources. Most of these apps were on the list of 59 apps already banned by government of India in June. The apps banned by GoI are now not available on the Google Playstore and Apple iStore for Indian users. There have reports of several Indian army officers and soldiers being target for soliciting sensitive information. The social media apps were used to set traps and allure them into revealing information. In 2018, it was reported that a IAF Group Captain was lured into revealing some information on IAF aircrafts by a Pakistani agent posing as a woman. There were reports of soldiers on duty in New Delhi who were honey-trapped by Pakistan accounts. In February this year, Indian Navy issued a directive after several sailors from Vizag, Karwar and a hawala operator were arrested for leaking information to Pakistan. It was reported that they were lured into online relationships. In most such cases, enemy agents pose as women and 'virtually' honey-trap Indian military personnel into divulging classified information. NIA investigation found that the Pakistan's ISI had used same set of social media IDs to trap the sailors.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/9/Indian-Army-bans-89-social-media-apps-for-its-soldiers-and-officers.html
Line of Actual Control: Evolving to becoming the Line of No Control?, 22-Jul-2020, - Col (Retd) Alok Mathur,"India has been trying to defend the points on LAC as marked on a handmade map. Sadly, the situation is such due to Chinese irascibility that the LAC has become a Line of No Control. What is definite here is that the Indian nation and particularly the Indian Army will not allow China to get away with its expansionist designs. India has a 3488 km long frontier with China along Xinjiang, Uygur, Zizhiqu and Tibet. Of this, 1597 km is in Ladakh, 200 km in Himachal Pradesh, 345 km in Uttrakhand, 220 km in Sikkim and 1126 km in Arunachal Pradesh. Interestingly, Xinjiang and Tibet regions are under the forcible occupation of China and should be called China Occupied East Turkestan (COET) and China Occupied Tibet (COT), respectively. The second interesting point is that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was not even born when the boundaries were firmed-in by the British and the existing governments of these regions on the principle of watershed and crest, from Karakoram Pass in Ladakh to Kibitu in East Arunachal Pradesh. In Ladakh, the border was well defined by the Dogra Dynasty rulers and was accepted by independent India on October 26, 1947, when Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu & Kashmir signed the Instrument of Accession to join the Indian Union. The boundary coincided with the “Johnson-Ardagh Line” of British India that had been accepted by the princely state of Jammu & Kashmir and Tibet. Johnson Ardagh Line British India wanted a clear demarcation line on Tibet/Xinjiang and Ladakh frontiers as a precaution against expansionist Russia. In 1865, Sir WH Johnson, then Surveyor General of India was given the responsibility to survey Ladakh. He endorsed that the border of Khotan, an ancient Kingdom now a part of Xinjiang, was till the Kun Lun mountain range and the Karakash Valley was within Jammu and Kashmir. The boundary of Jammu & Kashmir stretched from Sanju Pass in the west to Easternmost edge of Chang Chenmo Valley along with Kun Lun mountain range. The proposal was finally approved by Major General John Ardagh, Chief of Military Intelligence at London in 1897. The legal boundary between India and East Turkmenistan was thus based all along the Kun Lun Range and was called the “Johnson- Ardagh Line.” In 1893, Hung Ta Chen, a top Chinese official, provided to the Russians a map marked with frontiers coinciding with the Johnson-Ardagh Line. An Atlas published by the Government of China in 1933 showed the Johnson-Ardagh Line as a border between Xinjiang and India. Peking University Atlas also confirmed Aksai Chin as part of India. All parties thus accepted it as a frontier. The Government of India, post-independence, fixed the official boundary in the state of Jammu & Kashmir along the Kun Lun mountain range as defined by Johnson- Ardagh Line. McCartney McDonald Line The Chinese, in 1896, on instigation by the Russians, submitted a map to George McCartney, the British Counsel in Kashgar that proposed another boundary line in this region. The proposal was developed by Sir Claude Mcdonald, British Envoy in China and approved by Lord Elgin, Governor-General of India in 1899. The boundary line was shifted due South-West of Johnson Line along Lakstang Mountain Range. It placed Lingzi Plains in India, but Aksai Chin which was North of Lakstang range was shown as part of Tibet. This Line was not ratified by any government, but, CCP, in 1959, proposed to India to consider McCartney Line as the new frontier. CCP was ready to drop its claim on NEFA in return; the then Congress party-led Government in India did not agree. McMahon Line A treaty had been signed between Russia and Britain in 1907, accepting Chinese Suzerainty on Tibet. Tibetan rulers were not happy and refused to endorse the treaty, but under pressure and military coercion by the British, the terms were accepted. A tripartite conference was held at Shimla (Himachal Pradesh) on April 27 1914. The British representative was Sir Henry McMahon, Lanchen Shatara and nationalist China represented Tibet by Ivan Chen. Tibet and India signed the finalised map and proceeding (called the McMahon Line) on July 3, 1914. This was done in the absence of a Chinese representative and was later objected by China. Tibet had also wanted Tawang to be its part. In 1937, the Shimla Convention was approved by British India and Survey of India published maps showing McMahon Line as the International legal border between Tibet and India. After the collapse of the Qing dynasty, Tibet declared itself as an independent nation in 1915 under the 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso. Tawang was occupied in April 1938 by a special force led by Captain G S Lightfoot. When the force left, the Tibetans again moved into Tawang and occupied it till 1951. Post-Independence, the North-Eastern region was called the North-East Frontier Tract (NEFT). A column of 2 Assam Rifles led by Major Bob Khathing (A Tangkhul Naga) liberated Tawang on April 20, 1951, and unfurled the Tricolour at Bum la. Thus, McMahon Line became the legal frontier, and the region was renamed North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). Later, in 1972, it became the Union Territory of Arunachal Pradesh and a full-fledged State of the Indian Union on February 20 1987. The situation changed when the Communists came to power in China in October 1949. At that time, India, under Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, was aspiring leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement and following a foreign policy of “Peace and Tranquillity” with its neighbours. India was one of the first countries to recognise Communist China in 1949. Nehru further sponsored China to the United Nations and helped the country get a permanent seat in the Security Council. The Indian Government signed the Panchsheel Agreement with China. It was based on five principles of peaceful coexistence. Accordingly, there was very thin military deployment on the northern frontier by India. Independent India, post-1947, was absolutely clear that the International Border remained distinctly marked in East as McMahon Line; in Sikkim, Uttrakhand and Himachal Pradesh as the present Line and in Ladakh as the Johnson-Ardagh Line. Nehru was shocked when, in August 1950, Chinese troops annexed Tibet and made it a part of China. The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, signed a 17 point treaty with China in 1951. The Indian Government recognised Tibet as part of the People Republic of China. In 1956-57, there was an uprising in Tibet by CIA trained guerrillas who ambushed PLA convoys. The Chinese inducted several divisions and suppressed the rebellion. The Dalai Lama escaped in 1959 with his followers to Tawang and settled permanently in India. China then contended that Tibet had never been a sovereign nation and had no power to execute the treaty with India which created the McMahon Line. It claimed the whole of NEFA as South Tibet. In the northern frontier too, Chinese forces clandestinely occupied Aksai chin in 1956 and made a 185 km long Highway G-219 joining Xinjiang and Tibet. Delayed action by a sleeping India was the adoption of the “Forward Policy” which resulted in the Sino-India War of 1962. China launched a surprise attack across the McMahon Line and reached till Rupa Post on the foothills of the Himalayas overlooking the River Brahmaputra. This was the point of the Chinese claim and was almost 200 km into Indian Territory from Bum la, overrunning garrisons of Tawang, Se La and Bomdi la. Post the 1962 debacle, the Chinese did retreat but continued to occupy almost 38000 sq km of Indian Territory that they wanted. Zhau Enlai, in a polite letter to Nehru, christened the new boundary as Line of Actual Control (LAC) a loose ad hoc frontier based on the Actual Ground Position Line. Line of Actual Control (Line of No Control) The LAC runs from Karakoram Pass in the North West to Chumar camp across River Indus on a frontage of approximately 450 km. There are a few important features and river junctions on the LAC. Firstly, Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO), an old campsite and village just below the Karakoram Pass that has a functional Airstrip and is now linked with an all-weather Class 40, 255 km long road (DSDBO Road) from Darbuk Cantonment. Secondly, Chip Chap River Valley, that originates from the Karakoram range. Thirdly, Despang Plains where the LAC runs along a 25 km long open area. Fourthly, the Galwan River that is about 80 km long and originates from Samzunglin in Kun Lun mountains and joins the Shyok River. Fifthly, Chang Chenmo Valley in the south that touches Gogra camp and goes further 3 km to the east at Hot Springs police memorial point; Hot Springs is a hot Sulphur spring with a temperature of 107 Degree Fahrenheit even under sub-zero conditions. Another 6 km to the East is Kongka La held by India.  Sixthly, Pangong Lake where LAC crosses near Finger 8 and approaches Rezang La, East of Chusul. Seventhly, Village Demchok, in Nyoma Tehsil, an old British Military campsite on the Indus River, also called Demochang. Lastly, Chumar Camp, a Border outpost and meeting point located on an elevation of 16700 feet overlooking Himachal Pradesh. Thus, was created a new border which was not well defined, marked or based on a watershed and continues to create confusion. Despite all agreements, the Chinese keep declaring a new claim line to irritate India. They carry out illegal activities in buffer zones in the form of temporary intrusions. It has happened several times after the 1962 war. The Chinese were given a bloody nose in Nathu La and Cho La at Sikkim in 1967. Indian forces further checkmated them at Sumdorong Chu Valley, Twang in 1986/1987. They were stopped at DBO in 2000 and Shubansiri sector in Arunachal Pradesh in 2003; again at DBO in 2013. In the present context, they attempted an intrusion at Naku La on May 6, 2020, and again at Patrolling Point 14 in Galwan Valley on June 15 where they were forced back in a major clash with Indian forces. India has been trying to defend the points on LAC as marked on a handmade map. Sadly, the situation is such due to Chinese irascibility that the LAC has become a Line of No Control. What is definite here is that the Indian nation and particularly the Indian Army will not allow China to get away with its expansionist designs. The necessary national resolve and military power to ensure this is available with India. The sooner China realises this, the better.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh asks IAF to stand ready to handle any eventuality, 23-Jul-2020,,"The Air Force Commanders’ Conference (AFCC) was inaugurated by the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh on 22 Jul 20 at Air Headquarters (Vayu Bhawan). Chief of the Air Staff,Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria welcomed the Hon’ble Raksha Mantri and other senior officials from the MoD. In his address to the Air Force Commanders, Raksha Mantri appreciated the proactive response by the IAF in bolstering its operational capabilities over the past few months. He stated that the professional manner in which IAF conducted the air strikes in Balakot as well as rapid deployment of IAF assets at forward locations in response to the prevailing situation in Eastern Ladakh has sent a strong message to the adversaries. Raksha Mantri said that the nation’s resolve to defend its sovereignty stands firm on the faith its people have in the capability of its Armed Forces. He alluded to the ongoing efforts for de-escalation on LAC and urged the IAF to stand ready to handle any eventuality. He praised the stellar contribution by IAF in supporting the nation’s response to COVID-19 pandemic and the role played during several HADR missions. He highlighted the need to achieve self-reliance in defence production and noted that the theme chosen for this AFCC – ‘IAF in the Next Decade’ - was very apt for enhancing efforts towards indigenisation in the days to come. He lauded the progress made towards enhancing synergy and integration within the three services since the appointment of CDS and creation of DMA. The Raksha Mantri concluded by acknowledging IAF’s role in adapting to changes in technology and adopting emerging capabilities in Nano Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Cyber and Space domains.  He assured the commanders that all requirements of the Armed Forces, whether financial or otherwise, would be fulfilled. The CAS in his address to the Commanders stated that the IAF was well prepared to counter short term as well as strategic threats and the units were evenly poised to counter any aggressive action by the adversary. He noted that the response by all Commands in ensuring deployment and readiness of forces was prompt and laudable. He emphasized on the need to focus on the ability to handle situations at a short notice for ensuring a robust response. During the three day conference, commanders will review the current operational scenario and deployments before deliberating on building the IAF capabilities in the next decade to tackle all emerging threats.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/23/Rakshamantri-asks-IAF-to-stand-ready-to-handle-any-eventuality.html

The Patel Saga is still alive with Statue of Unity: An Insight, 31-Oct-2020,,"Gopal Goswami ""Do we need statues or schools, Hospitals! this much money could have been given to the welfare of the poor."" We have heard a lot about the Statue of the Legend, the unifier of modern Bharat, The Iron man Sardar Patel. When Narendra Modi as Chief Minister of Gujarat has announced this project in 2010, It was widely criticised by the so-called elite literate, intellectuals and the opposition precisely. There were wage estimations. Controversy over its being made in China, though it was only the cavity part of bronze which was imported as China is the only manufacturer of it. Larsen & Toubro, our own Indian construction company, has built it before the estimated time.  The point of discussion should have been 'why Modi chose this destination for building the statue'? the place is neither Sardar Patel's birthplace nor any historical significance with Sardar Patel or his work. His birthplace is just 3 hours away from Narmada!  Then why Narendra Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat chose one of the country's most backward districts for it? As per the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, GOI. with 90% rural and over 82% tribal population, Narmada is one of the most backward districts in terms of modern-day development despite the fact, it is the biggest receiver of backward region Grant Fund Program from Government of India. What happened to the funds received throughout the years right after independence? Nobody knows, one can still find a half-naked older man moving bare feet with his 3-4 goats. Statue of Unity has marked as the prodigious statue of Indian Statesman and independence activist Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel since its commencement. The First Deputy Prime Minister & Home Minister of independent India is highly revered for his able leadership in uniting 562 princely states and redrawing the political boundaries of the Union of India. Statue of Unity is situated in the vicinity of Satpura Hills of Gujarat. The grandeur of 182 meters (597 ft.) tall statue has bagged it the title of being the tallest of its kind in the world. The project was announced by Shri Narendra Modi at a press conference in the year 2010, and what better a place to erect a monument dedicated to the Iron Man of India, than the Sardar Sarovar Dam built on river Narmada which is 3 hours away from his cradle, Nadiad. There are reasons beyond this to build the statue at this place. According to the Census of 2011, the population of Narmada district is approximately 5.9 lakhs, spread over 2,755 sq.km. area out of which 82% comprises of the tribal community. Small-time agriculture and casual labour are a vital means of their livelihood. Gujarat ranks second among the most developed and prosperous states in India. However, the majority of these inhabitants struggle to manage a square meal a day. Although access to potable water, primary healthcare and education has altered this scenario to some extent, poverty remains a matter of concern and requires immediate attention. Major problems arise for these tribal-natives after the season of monsoon when they start migrating to nearby towns of Vadodara, Bharuch, Surat and Ahmedabad as a construction labourer, farmworkers and hire hands in search of livelihood. Gujarat accounts for 8.1% of the Scheduled Tribe population of the country. The tribal population of Gujarat, numbering 89.17 lakh, constitute 14.8% of the state's population. The TSP area constitutes 18% of the state's geographical area. There are 11 major tribes in Gujarat; the largest Bhil, constituting 47.89% of the state's tribal population. Amar Singh Chaudhary was the first Chief Minister from the tribal community to take the oath on July 6, 1985 and retained office until December 9 1989. Later, his son, Dr Tushar Chaudhary became the Minister of Highway, Surface Transport and Aviation in the UPA government but nothing has changed for tribal peoples even after 60 years of the history of the establishment of this state. Very little has been done for the tribal communities, but they continue to be a favourable vote bank for political parties. Why Modi Chose Narmada for Statue? Poverty is a Greenfield for missionaries who enter remote tribal regions and carry out large scale conversion in the pretext of providing services like healthcare and education. Areas ranging from Umargam of Gujarat to Jhabua of Madhya Pradesh and Jhalor of Rajasthan, where more than 80% of the population is tribal, have always been vulnerable to missionary activities from Europe and America. Poverty is a catalyst for religious conversions and has become equivalent to a lucrative business in the contemporary scenario. Hundreds of churches mushroomed in each tribal district. VHP national general secretary, Y Raghavulu, claimed that 8 lakh Hindus are converted into other religions each year. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar once wrote to a Bangalore based tabloid saying that, ""Converting myself into Islam or Christianity will shift my loyalty towards Mecca or the Vatican, so I would much rather convert into Buddhism."" As he foresaw the result of converting into Semitic religions. Naxal activities in tribal areas are evident, carving out a separate 'Bhilistan' out of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan has already been done by the missionary & Naxal backed BTS. Where 'Bhilistan Tiger Sena' thrives under few tribal leaders influenced by foreign missionaries, Naxalites and other anti-national forces. The then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Mr Narendra Modi, gazed this danger and wisely chose Narmada district for the establishment of the Statue of Unity, which falls almost at the centre and proposed capital of Bhilistan. The erection of this monument has enabled developmental activities in the area by generating employment for the tribal youth; they have become less prone to the influence of so-called Bhilistan Tiger Force to join illegal activities. The statue had an unprecedented influx of visitors within the first week of its inauguration. It has marked as the most visited place in India after our Muths and Mandirs. Many national & International conferences are being organised at the tent city facility. As tourism and urbanisation will follow, the peripheral services will grow around the statue. This will generate more employment and increase the standard of living of the people dwelling in the region. As per estimates, 5,000 to 10,000 hands will be employed in different categories over 3-5 years around the reservoir, and the number of daily visitors could be anything between 30,000 to 40,000 people per day. With the proposed rail and air connectivity, the statue will soon beat Statue of Liberty in New York or Burj-Khalifa in terms of daily visitors and earnings both. The foremost notable achievement is the very idea of Bhilisthan is now under threat, so are its leaders. They know for a fact that development will bring in employment and upliftment of the tribal region, it will be the death rattle of their anti-national activities, thus have started to create disturbance and resistance in the region, its epicentre being the district of Narmada. They have started mobilising agitations and propaganda, saying that the local farmers are not happy with the decision and that the government has forcefully acquired their land for the construction of the statue. While the truth remains that SSNL has acquired the land on the banks of Narmada for the construction of the reservoir long ago and no fresh land has been acquired for this purpose. The locals are satisfied as the footfalls are increasing in the region and the requirement of food items, vegetables, milk and manpower for hospitality are on a steady rise. The need for utility guides, drivers, etc. are increasing, and the tribal youth will not migrate elsewhere in search for livelihood. In a way, Narendra Modi has once again placed Sardar in his true spirit. Such are the legends of a visionary leader who turns a threat into an opportunity. Sardar Patel is such a legend that he is serving his countrymen even after 67 years of his demise. Sardar is safeguarding our tribal brethren from being misled and prevented Narmada from becoming Bastar or Dantewada of Gujarat.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/10/31/The-Patel-Saga-.html
Kartik Oraon: Pioneering leader who strived to end reservations for the converted tribals, 29-Oct-2020,,"Ramesh Babu Shri. Kartik Oraon was a legendary Janjati leader hailed from Karounda Littatoli village of Gumla district of Present-day Jharkhand. He represented Lohardaga Parliamentary constituency thrice and had been a minister in the government led by Smt. Indira Gandhi. His entire life was committed to the cause of protection and upliftment of Scheduled Tribes People. After completion of his degree from Bihar Engineering College, Patna, he moved to England for further studies. He served the nation from various capacities as a promising engineer. But his mind was always thrilled to work for the more considerable interest of people belonging to the Scheduled tribe. Hence he joined politics in 1962. He fought to safeguard the land alienation of tribes. It was because of his relentless effort that an Agricultural university was established in Ranchi. He was a crusader against the proselytising activities of Christian Missionaries. Shri Kartik Oraon gave a clarion Call against converted persons taking benefits of genuine Scheduled Tribe members. He experienced converted persons taking away the facilities. It hurt him too much. With this anguish, he wrote a book in Hindi titled ""Bees Varsh Kee Kali Raat""(Dark Nights of Twenty Years). The title of the book expressed the desperation of Scheduled Tribes after 20 years of Indian Independence. During the pre-independence period, Janjatis' rights had been curtailed through draconian laws, one after another, enacted by British. They were pushed out of their original abode, and their entry into the forest was restricted. The resources in their land were mercilessly extracted andtransported to Europe. Their life became pathetic during the British era. Manyrevolutionaries like Birsa Munda, Sidhu, Kano, Neelambar, Peetambar, Tilka Majhi, Veer Narayan, Shankar Sha and Raghunath Shah, Thalakkal Chandu etc. gotup against the injustice. It was quite natural that there had been a high aspiration among the tribal youths of those days. As enshrined in the constitution, they expected that a lot would be done to their upliftment and welfare. When theywere put into a separate schedule for focused development, they thought their dark nights were about to vanish once and forever. But, when they saw that converted people were availing the benefits of Reservation Policy, keeping manyas just onlookers, they understood that dawn on their horizon is, yet, too far. Leaders like Sardar Patel were true visionaries. The Advisory Committee constituted by Constituent Assembly on Minorities Rights, Fundamental Rights etc. headed by Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had classified the minorities and explained that barring Anglo Indians, all other Christians of India wouldfall under the category of Indian Christians and they would not be given any benefit under Reservation Policy. Commenting on it, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar saidthat Muslims had been getting the benefit of protection starting from 1892 fora period of at least 60 years. Christians enjoyed the facilities since 1920 for 28 years. Harijans had been getting benefits since 1935 for a shorter period, and he recommended it to be continued further. Referring to  Scheduled Tribe, Dr Ambedkar further said ""I am ready to give the benefits to the scheduled tribe for a longer period"" It clearly shows that the Indian Christians enjoying the benefits of the reservation is unconstitutional and hence, highly condemnable. With this anguish but with high expectation, Shri Kartik Oraon approached Smt. Indira Gandhi. He submitted a memorandum citing his deep pain and suggesting certain amendments. 235 members of Lok Sabha shared his pain and signed in support of his memorandum. They had signed in support of the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Bill, 1967. The amendment suggested in the memorandum was, ""3. Notwithstanding anything contained in Paragraph 2, no person who has given up tribal faith or faiths and has embraced either Christianity or Islam shall be deemed to be a member of any Scheduled Tribes"". (Vide Para 2A, Page 29, Line 38 of Schedule II of the report) But unfortunately, his voice with a support of 235 members of Lok Sabha was left unheard, and the memorandum was kept in abeyance. Congress, under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, did not pay any heed to the genuine demand which was raised in the interest of genuine Tribesmen. She was under the pressure of MPs from Nagaland and Meghalaya who were Christian converts, elected from reserved ST seats. After Kartik Oraon, no tribal leaders have raised the issue. There was not enough awareness among the youths belonging to the genuine tribal group about the memorandum, and it never came into light for almost three decades. Slowly and gradually, the awareness started picking up among the youth, and they once again felt the necessity of preventing others from taking the benefit meant to genuine tribes. In 2006, a frontal organisation was formed in the name of 'Janjati Suraksha Manch (JSM)' under the leadership of Late Morensingh Purti, a veteran Janjati leader and also a former Member of Parliament with a sole objective of delisting converted people from the List of Scheduled Tribes. JSM followed the footprints of Late: Kartik Oraon.  JSM fought against the injustice of siphoning the benefits by converted persons who are educationally and economically well off in comparison with the genuine members of STs. JSM conducted a Signature Campaign in 2009 in this connection. 27.67 lakh people above 18 years of age from all over India signed the memorandum during the campaign. A team of tribal leaders led by late Shri Jagdevram Oraon met Smt. Pratibha Devi Singh Patil, the then President of India and submitted the memorandum seeking delisting of converted persons from ST. But the second effort also went in vain as the then UPA government did not show any sign of cognizance of the signatures obtained from remote areas of our country. Dr J.K. Bajaj, Director, Centre for Policy Studies, had initiated a study on actual beneficiaries of provisions under reservation and presented a report. Alarming Facts and figures were unearthed. It showed the large scale drainage of benefits in favour of converted persons. 40 years have passed since the demise of Late Shri Kartik Oraon. October 29, 2020, is his 96th birth anniversary day. JSM resolved to celebrate Kartikji's birth anniversary in a big way this year by highlighting the contents of his memorandum once again, with the hope that it could help to heal the widening wound. This time, the memorandum will be submitted to DCs addressing both Honorable President and Honorable Prime Minister of India at more than 200 tribal districts. It is quite unfortunate that after 73 years of Independence still Christians (Converted STS) are grabbing the lion's share of benefits meant for Scheduled Tribes.  JSM appeals to the government that there should be clarity in provisions of reservation as in the case of  Scheduled Castes that the moment a person embraced either Christianity or Islam his/her constitutional status would be changed and he/she shall not remain a member of Scheduled Tribe.  Recently, Dr Nishikant Dube has raised this issue in Lok Sabha during Zero Hour. He, too, has said that like schedule casts, converted members of the Scheduled tribe also should be barred from taking benefits of  Reservation Policy. Some Members of Parliament have, for the first time after Shri Kartik Oraon raised the issue in Lok Sabha. The voice of resentment, thus,once again echoed on the walls of Lok Sabha. This is, in fact, a matter of great satisfaction.

Panic in Assam after illegal monetary transactions to media go viral on social media, 31-Oct-2020,,"NJ Thakuria Guwahati: The development started with a sheet of exposed paper, written as confidential, that depicted a list of beneficiaries among some mainstream media houses based in Silchar and Guwahati.  Claimed as prepared on October 21, 2020, the list mentions a number of satellite news channels (Pratidin Time, Assam Talks, Prag News, News Live, NE Live) and newspapers (Niyamiya Barta, Jugasankha, Dainik Prantajyoti, Navabarta Prasanga, Samayik Prasanga, etc.) along with a press association as being offered monthly contribution (protection money) by the truckers.  It also added the name of Sanjib Jaiswal (owner of news channel DY365), Manoj Nath (president of Guwahati Press Club) with a few others along with the Cachar police, Karimganja police (in Assam) and Meghalaya police personnel as due beneficiaries. The expenditure to carry ‘coil’ (coal?) involving payments to media groups (even though the particular paper is not authenticated) may trigger huge repercussions among the common people, argued Journalists’ Forum Assam (JFA). In a statement, the forum has already expressed grave concern over the exposure and appealed to all concerned media persons (named in the list) to clarify their stand effectively. “The paper is made viral in social media including influential WhatsApp groups which would multiply the number of viewers within a short span of time even the mainstream media may ignore the revelation,” said JFA president Rupam Barua adding that the media should stand united and react to the development collectively at the earliest.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/10/31/Panic-rushes-in-Assam.html

"Amartya Sen busts the myth of the 'Kerala Model', rejecting it as mere ‘rhetoric’", 16-Apr-2020,,"The early usage of term ‘Kerala Model’ dates back to 1970s, a period of time when the Communist Party took initiatives to establish the Centre for Development Studies in Kerala and accommodate high-profile economists in such institutions in order to create a new narrative in the field of development economics. However, the term gained currency after the release of ' An Uncertain Glory: India and Its Contradictions', a book written by Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen and his co-author Jean Drèze. The discussions and lectures centred around the book had brought back ‘Kerala Model’ again under the spotlight. The Communist leaders and self-proclaimed economists profusely quoted Amartya Sen and his book to establish their propaganda of  'Kerala Model of Development', which seeks to establish that the achievements of the present state of Kerala are a direct outcome of socio-economic policies of the various Left Governments in the state. Taking the narrative further, the Leftist journalists had launched massive propaganda through mainstream media, highlighting the myth of Kerala Model under the guise of the book marketing campaign. Rattled by the Communist propaganda, Amartya Sen and Jean Drèze published a note in the subsequent edition of An Uncertain Glory: India and Its Contradictions'. However, it did not get much public attention and the CPM leaders continue to misquote Amartya Sen, harping on the myth of the Kerala Model. What Amartya Sen and Jean Drèze said about the 'rhetoric of Kerala Model'? ""The term 'Kerala Model' has often been used in this literature (the literature cited in the text), and more distressingly has occasionally been attributed- entirely erroneously- to our analysis. We have never used this particular 'rhetoric'. There is much to learn from scrutinizing the experience of Kerala- and of the other high-performing states- 'but there is little evidence for seeing Kerala as a model to be mechanically emulated'."" (Notes- 3. Indian in Comparative Perspective), An Uncertain Glory: India and Its Contradictions page No: 346. Rejecting the propaganda of 'Kerala Model', Amartya Sen and Jean Drèze explained it in simple terms that there is little evidence for seeing Kerala as a model to be mechanically emulated. However, even now the CPM has no qualms to misquote Amartya Sen and claim the patronage of Kerala Model, sweeping the achievements of Travancore in the fields of education and health under the carpet. Interestingly, much later in 2016, Amartya Sen verbally thrashed the CPM over its ‘Bengal Model’, accusing the Left party of ruining the economy and industrial development in the state of West Bengal. ""The Left has played a major role in destroying industrialisation in Bengal. We must accept that. Only when they decided that policies must be changed, the people decided to change the government instead. I think there is some problem in the way with which the Left party thinks over an issue,"" Sen said while delivering a lecture at a college in Santiniketan.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/4/16/Amartya-Sen-busts-the-myth-of-the-Kerala-Model-.html
"Swadeshi Sankalp Diwas - Embrace Swadeshi, Boycott Chinese", 25-Apr-2020,- Ashwani Mahajan,"The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) has given a call for Swadeshi Divas on 25th April i.e today. From 6.30 to 6.40 evening the nation will pray for early relief from Corona, to boycott Chinese products and services and for embracing Swadeshi.  The globe is engulfed by a virus called Covid 19, also known as China Virus and rightly so. The virus had its origins in the Wuhan province of China and begun as early as December, 19. But the world had come to know of it only during late January and early February, 20. It took two months to pierce the Great Wall of China but the humanity is paying a very high price. Several nations are getting ready to drag China to International Court of Justice demanding trillions of dollars in compensation. There are serious charges against the Chief of the World Health Organisation accusing him of playing to the tune of China and the U.S., has indicated its intention to stop financial support. The number of persons inflicted by the disease is in lakhs and those died are in several thousands outside India. The virus has entered our country also but the number of affected persons are in thousands while the number of persons succumbed is in hundreds only. Due to early warning signals, the Honorable Prime Minister, after preparing the nation through a 14 hour Janata Curfew, imposed a national lockdown, initially for a period of 21 days and extended it by another 19 days. This bold measure helped to contain the spread of the virus and succeeded to a large extent. The entire nation stood as one man behind the Prime Minister. On the positive side, the virus imparted a BEHAVIOURAL STIMULUS on the people. It has brought several of our traditional practises back. Saying Namaste instead of handshake, giving out the habit of embracing and maintaining a safe distance, adoption of hygienic habits in day to day to life like washing hands etc. It has also generated a lot of interest, particularly in the post 90 generation towards our traditional food habits instead of Pizzas etc., The youth started looking up to our age old treasure of Pranayama, Yoga (popularised through the globe by our P.M.) and meditation. There are one line discourses teaching Indian Management Thoughts and the spiritual Gurus have become modern day counselors. The nation witnessed the services rendered by our Swadeshi retail traders in reaching out to the people with essential supply of Foodgrains, Medicines and vegetables braving Carona. The civil society rose in unison and rendered yeoman service by reaching out to the needy for their needs. The nation understood the value of these people.  In matter of days our entrepreneurs came out with dozens and dozens of new innovations. New low cost perfect ventilator from Coimbatore and many other areas, offer to produce and supply millions of PPE equipments from Tirupur are among them. A Belgaum based company, called VEGA with technology from DRDO has begun kiosks for sample collection. These are like telephone booths where the patient is inside and the doctor is outside. Not only from India but International enquiries are flooding the company. Pune based RAKSHA Polycoats, has begun manufacturing isolation chambers. This type of innovations are growing in hundreds every day. When Railways converted the ac coaches to moving hospital wards, the world was astonished. This is what we call Swadeshi Spirit. Indian pharma Industry supplied medicines to about 60 countries in matter of days and endeared itself to the whole world. Seeds for gaining the Status of the Medical factory of the world are sown. Conspiracy or no conspiracy, there is anti China mood both within India and outside. The Indian Industry has realised the dangers of doing business with China. There will be strenuous efforts to restrict imports from China. This will strengthen our manufacturing creating lakhs and lakhs of employment.  While industry will take steps to reduce Chinese import, consumers will boycott everything that is Chinese from mobiles to washing machines to electrical goods. This is the mood the nation. While industry will take steps to reduce  Chinese import, consumers will boycott everything that is Chinese from mobiles to washing machines to electrical goods. This is the mood the nation. Internationally disruptions to global supply chain has begun and thousands of companies are getting ready to leave China and enter India. Bharat should align with the like minded nations to capture the space going to be vacated by China internationally. In 2014 and again in 2017, the communist party of China that all Chinese companies must collaborate in gathering intelligence. ( the extract from forthcoming book H.R. McMASTER, the former NSA in the U.S., Government under President TRUMP). Several nations have understood the trap of Chinese Investments. China lends at most favourable terms to itself. Once the debt reaches unsustainable levels,  China trades for equity to gain control of their ports, airports, dams, power plants and communication net works and there are numerous example through out the world. Now several countries have started bidding good bye to Chinese investments. To conclude there is the SWADESHI SPIRIT IS ENGULFING THE NATION TO DECISIVELY BOYCOTT CHINESE. The SJM will sustain this spirit continuously to make Bharath GLOBAL LEADER. The SJM has given a call for Swadeshi Divas on 25th April. From 6.30 to 6.40 evening the nation will pray for early relief from Carona, to boycott Chinese products and services and for embracing Swadeshi. Let us all join hands.

Mumbai can still become International Financial Services Centre if Maha Govt desires!, 04-May-2020,,"The polarised society needs to understand that Mumbai has a natural International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) ecosystem and it can still become International Financial Services Centre if Maharashtra Government desires. Well, how does the financial capital status of Mumbai come under threat as the RBI, SEBI in Mumbai are still the roots to the nation? Wonder why some people chose to have a selective memory when they want to blame everything on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling government. The Maharashtra Gujarat fight is again to happen as Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday decided to locate the newly created International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) Authority in Gandhinagar. But the thruth has something different to serve the PM Modi haters community. The polarised society needs to understand that Mumbai has a natural IFSC ecosystem and it can still become International Financial Services Centre if Maharashtra Government desires. The headquarters is announced at Gandhinagar as it is the only functional IFSC today. Those who are beating the chest now were in power from 2007 to 2014 & did nothing for Mumbai IFSC and that void was captured by the then CM Narendra Modi in Gujarat. In 2007, at Vibrant Gujarat Summit, the then Gujarat CM announced GIFT City Ahmedabad to be developed as IFSC and appointed ECADI for its planning. By 2012 all plans of IFSC at Gujarat were ready and work had almost started. In 2015, the government of India enacted a law to govern IFSC and immediately Gift City proposal was submitted and eventually Mumbai’s proposal was also submitted. GIFT city was in advanced stage so it got approval and Mumbai BKC proposal faced technical problem for want of 50 hectare contiguous land. A solution was found to it and again a proposal was sent after appointing consultants and making all the plans. The Central Government also took into account the IFSC plans at BKC while planning the bullet train station and station is planned in such a way that IFSC building will come on it. In the meantime GIFT city had already started functioning and the then Finance Ministre Arun Jaitely said that we are trying to see if 2 IFSCs can coexist. GoM submitted a report on how they can coexist and that is still under consideration. And it is now, in December 2019 that the Government of India enacted a law to create an Authority to regulate financial services center and its headquarters is now notified in Ahmedabad.

Chinese companies in India dither to join country’s fight against Coronavirus; Make negligible contributions for the sake of optics, 29-May-2020,,"The major Chinese companies including Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo, Huawei, Oneplus whose annual revenue is approximately INR 60710 crore, have just contributed INR 24 crore (0.04%) for India’s fight against coronavirus pandemic. As PM Modi said, “Crisis is also an opportunity to boost Make in India and reduce dependence on other countries”, meaningful and significant changes do happen by chance. Without a high degree of awareness, we may not notice the changes for a long time—or until others comment on them. In this sense, desired changes often appear discontinuous. In complexity theory, these surprises are called “emergence.” This social auditing of Chinese companies contribution in India’s fight against Covid19 is an attempt to impinge Indian citizens to broach the criticality of PM Modi’s statement i.e. reducing dependence on other countries. The major seven Chinese companies (namely: Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo, Huawei, ZTE, Sany, Oneplus) in India with annual revenue of approximately INR 60710 crore just contributed INR 24 crore (0.04%) for India’s fight against coronavirus pandemic. Please do remember these companies are earning from the Indian market for the past many years. Thus, this behavioural pattern of Chinese companies suggests that for them India is just a market. In terms of contributing to India’s fight against coronavirus pandemic, ZTE India, which has an annual revenue of more than INR 500 crore and has achieved up to $1billion in past, has so far contributed nothing as per the public sources. Vivo India, which has an annual revenue of INR 11154 crores has just distributed 1 lakh masks and several small contributions. Oppo India, which has an annual revenue of INR 12024 crores has just contributed 1 crore. One plus with annual revenue of INR 150 crore has just contributed 1 crore, 7,050 PPE suites and 6,220 medical Goggles. Sany India with annual revenue of INR 1000 crore has contributed by deducting part of Indian staff salary. Although, Sany India claims to provide food supplies to more than 600 families and masks to some hospitals. Huawei India with annual revenue of INR 12884 crore and has achieved up to $1billion several times in past, has contributed merely 7 crores. Xiaomi India with annual revenue of INR 23000 crore has contributed merely 15 crores. This endorses the Swadeshi Jagran Manch’s assessment about China that Indians should boycott Chinese products. Every Indian who thinks China is responsible for this coronavirus catastrophe and are using products of above mentioned Chinese companies are living in dichotomy. “Pari passu to trade deficient reduction, Trust deficient lessening between India and China is also desperately needed. And this is the time to act on reduction of both deficient, Companies can play a vital role. Not everything should be pushed to governments. Both Indian and Chinese governments are doing their parts” said Prasoon Sharma, Pentland-Churchill Scholar, New York University and University College London.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/29/Chinese-companies-in-India-dither-to-join-countrys-fight-against-Coronavirus.html
"Prime Ministers chairs Cabinet Meeting to give a historic boost to Rural India", 04-Jun-2020,,"Prime Minister Modi Chaired the Union Cabinet on June 3, 2020, Several landmarks and historical decisions were taken in the meeting, which will go a long way in helping India's farmers while also transforming the agriculture sector Essential Commodities Act a historic amendment was approved by the Cabinet, a visionary step towards the transformation of agriculture and raising farmers' income. As India has become a surplus in most agricultural-commodities, farmers are getting better prices due to lack of investment in cold storage, warehouses, processing and export as the entrepreneurial spirit gets dampened due to hanging sword of Essential Commodities Act This act will be a massive benefit for rural India, With the amendment to Essential Commodities Act, commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes will be removed from the list of essential products. This will eliminate fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in their business operations. The Government has also safeguarded the interest of consumers while liberalising the regulatory environment, has also ensured that the benefits of consumers are protected. It has been provided in the amendment, that in situations such as war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamity, such agricultural foodstuff can be regulated.   This amendment in the act will help both farmers and consumers and will bring in price stability. It will create a competitive market environment and also prevent the wastage of agricultural products due to lack of storage facilities. This will also lead to barrier-free trade in agricultural production.` Cabinet approved 'The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce', ""The Ordinance will create an ecosystem where the farmers and traders will enjoy the freedom of choice of sale and purchase of agri-produce. It will also promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade and commerce outside the physical premises of markets notified under State Agricultural Produce Marketing legislations. This is a historic-step in unlocking the vastly regulated agriculture markets in the country"" states Prime Minister's Office Farmers will also be able to do electronic trading in transaction platform for ensuring a seamless trade electronically, reduce marketing costs for the farmers and help them in getting better prices. This will undoubtedly lead to One India, One Agriculture Market and will lay the foundation for ensuring golden harvests for our hard-working farmers. The Union Cabinet also approved 'The Farmers Empowerment and Protection Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020'. Farmers can now engage with processors, wholesalers, aggregators, wholesalers, large retailers, exporters etc., on a level playing field without any fear of exploitation, and there will be no risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor and also enable the farmers to access modern technology and better inputs. It will reduce the cost of marketing and improve the income of farmers. Farmers will get access to technology and advice for high-value agriculture and get a ready market for such products, will now engage in direct marketing, thereby eliminating intermediaries resulting in full realisation of price. The Government has also announced the various provision of concessional credit for the welfare of farmers through Kisan Credit Cards, financing facility for agri-infra projects, Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana and other measures to strengthen fisheries, vaccination against Foot & Mouth Disease and Brucellosis, Herbal Cultivation promotion, boost to beekeeping, Operation Green etc. as a part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan to provide a boost to those engaged in agriculture and allied activities. ""Through PM KISAN, over 9.54 crore farmer families (as on first June 2020) have benefited and an amount of Rs. 19,515 crore has been disbursed so far during the lockdown period.

Andaman – The New Hong Kong: Can Veer Savarkar’s “Taap Bhumi” be the QUAD Free Trade Zone?, 15-Jun-2020,,"Since its creation as a free port in the mid-nineteenth century, Hong Kong’s raison d’être has been to aid a middleman between China and the rest of the world. The opening up of China during the late 1970s and the advancement of globalization further boosted this role and resoluteHong Kong’s position in the international division of labour (Augustin-Jean 2005; Zhao et al. 2012). Nevertheless, in recent years, Hong Kong’s role as a (business) hub has been slightly affected by China’s changing position in the world economy. This can be realised in the evolution of four critical rudiments of the Hong Kong economy, which have played a vital role in its function as an intermediary between China and the world on the one hand and as a global city on the other: (1) Foreign Direct Investments (FDI); (2) trade and logistics; (3) finance; and (4) tourism – the last three having been acknowledged ‘pillar industries’ by the Hong Kong government during 2002–2003. Hong Kong’s manufacturers, who relocated their production of toys, electronics, textiles and plastics to factories in mainland China three decades ago, are on the move again. This time, they are moving their production lines to Malaysia, Vietnam and lower-cost economies in Southeast Asia to dodge rising wages and land costs, and in search of safe havens from the intensifying trade war between US and China, said by the representative of 150 manufacturers with a combined workforce of 1 million and HK$200 billion (US$25.5 billion) in annual production. In 2019, US companies had the world’s most significant number of regional headquarters in Hong Kong i.e. 278 (18% of the city’s total of 1,541, although that number was down 4 per cent from a year earlier). In total, there are about 1,300 American companies in Hong Kong. After the historic virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who concluded nine agreements including a Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) and issued a joint statement on a “Shared Vision for Maritime Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.”, the QUAD coalition is ready. BecauseIndia is ready to allow Australia to join the annual trilateral Malabar naval exercise involving India-Japan-USA. The QUAD coalition should also provide the replacement of Hong-Kong and permanent mechanism to solve South-China sea problem. In this regard, the Andaman is one of the best available options because of its proximity to the Malacca Straits and its geopolitical demography. Today over one-third of world trade and one-half of the world’s oil shipments transit the Malacca Straits, including 80 per cent of Japan’s oil imports, 80 per cent of China’s oil imports, and 90 per cent of South Korea’s oil imports. Numerous LNG tankers destined for Japan and South Korea, the two largest LNG importers, also traverse the waterway. After attaining independence from Britain and Malaysia, Singapore concentrated its economy seaward, using its natural deepwater port on the world’s busiest shipping way to build a flourishing transhipment hub. Singapore capitalized in port infrastructure, while the rise of containerization set the maritime city-state on a remarkable growth path. Moreover, Singapore constructed one of the world’s most wide-ranging maritime innovation clusters, offering maritime support services ranging from bunkering to ship repair to maritime arbitration. However, Singapore is not alone among flourishing seaports on the Malacca Straits. The Port of Tanjung Pelepas, situated in Malaysia’s Johor province, opened in 2000 as a direct competitor to nearby Singapore. Maersk established primary container operations in Tanjung Pelepas, in part, to pressure the Port of Singapore to lower container handling prices. Malaysia’s Port Klang is another major container hub on the Malacca Straits, serving the economic zone surrounding Kuala Lumpur. After US withdrawal of special status to Hong Kong, the world needs new free port and financial hub in Asia, the existing options like Singapore, Malaysia may not be able to provide a base to all the exiting companies and business from Hong-Kong. Thus, the Andaman can not only accommodate the shifting companies from Hong-Kong but also diminish the container handling prices by reducing the burden from existing ports like Singapore and Malaysia. Further, the Andaman can become intermediary between QUAD and the world on the one hand and as India’s global city on the other based on following four pillars: (1) Foreign Direct Investments (FDI); (2) trade and logistics; (3) finance; and (4) tourism.

#BoycottChina campaign gains steam as Swadeshi Jagran Manch and CAIT urge Center to ban Chinese companies from government tenders and boycott China economically too, 17-Jun-2020,,"The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) and the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) have called for economic boycott of China amidst the battle between Indian soldiers with Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh. The Chinese troops attacked Indian soldiers in a cowardly manner resulting in the supreme sacrifice of 20 Indian soldiers. Ashwani Mahajan, co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch has said, ""This incident will remove the veil from the eyes of those who say that there was no firing. We should boycott China economically."" Earlier, SJM had demanded the Delhi-Meerut RRTS project should be given to an Indian company instead of the Chinese firm. Mahajan had  tweeted, ""Tibet should be returned to the Tibetans to establish peace in the region."" CAIT lists 450 Chinese products On the other hand, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has launched a campaign to take on China economically. CAIT has launched the 'Indian Goods - Our pride' campaign to boycott Chinese products and promote the use of Indian goods. CAIT has listed 450 products imported from China which have to be boycotted. Calling for a boycott of these Chinese goods, CAIT has said that its objective is to bring down the imports from China from the present 70 billion dollars i.e. about 5.25 lakh crores rupees to 13 billion dollars or about one lakh crores rupees. This will hurt the Chinese economy immensely says the CAIT. Promote India Made Products The list of Chinese products prepared by CAIT include everyday items like furnishing fabrics, toys, household items, gems & jewelery, footwear, apparel, textiles, building hardware, electrical & electronics, kitchen items, luggage, hand bags, cosmetics, gift items, Fashion Apparel, Food, Watches, Clothing, Stationery, Paper, Furniture, Lighting, Health Products, Packaging Products, Auto Parts, Feng Shui Items, Diwali & Holi Items, Eyeglasses, Tapestry Material etc. CAIT National President BC Bhartia and General Secretary Praveen Khandelwal have said that currently India's imports from China amount to about 5.25 lakh crores or 70 billion dollars annually. CAIT has selected more than 3000 India made products in the first phase, which are alternatives to Chinese goods. However, all these products were being imported from China as they were cheaper than India made products. However, given the emerging border scenario both SJM and CAIT have vowed to educate and urge people to boycott Chinese products in all aspects of life.

Indian Railways cancels Chinese company’s contract worth Rs 470 Cr; Govt to drop Delhi-Meerut Delhi-Meerut RRTS project after SJM’s call to #BoycottChina, 18-Jun-2020,,"The Indian Railways’ Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL) has decided to terminate the contract with China. The China-based Beijing National Railway Research & Design Institute of Signal & Communication had got the signalling contract worth Rs 471 crore in 2016. As per the contract, the Chinese company was supposed to complete the signalling and telecommunication work of the 417-km long Kanpur-Deen Dayal Upadhyay section. However, the Chinese firm had only completed 20 per cent of the work in four years. The decision came close on the heels with Chinese attack in Ladakh region in which 20 Indian soldiers were martyred. Amid the Chinese aggression in Ladakh, the Ministry of Urban Development may retender Delhi-Meerut RRTS (Regional Rapid Transit System) project as the China-based Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co Limited (STEC) emerged as the lowest bidder for the construction of a 5.6 km underground section between New Ashok Nagar and Sahibabad of Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor. According to reports, five national and multinational bidders including L&T, and Tata Projects Limited, had submitted their bids for the project being managed by the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC). STEC bid Rs 1,126.9 crore versus L&T’s Rs 1,170 crore. The Centre had invited bids for the project in November last year. The technical bid was opened on March 16 earlier this year. The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) had come up with a strong objection against the tender, urging the government to cancel STEC's bid and award the project to Indian companies. In the wake of the Chinese aggression and under mounting pressure from the SJM, the Union Ministry of Urban Development has not finalised the tender. According to the sources, the Urban Development Ministry will review the entire process. The 39 per cent of the project is funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  Even though there are reports that the contract cannot be cancelled as it is against the norms of the ADB, the sources in the Government said that the MoHUA would not award the contract to the Chinese firm. The Ministry may consider retendering the project as there are many Indian companies have already come forward to bid for the project. ",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/18/Indian-Railways-cancels-Chinese-company-s-contract-worth-470-Cr-after-SJMs-call-to-BoycottChina.html
COVID19 : This Crisis must Transform India’s Education and Skilling, 27-May-2020,- Raj Nehru,"The Centre and State governments should constitute a task force comprising all stakeholders to assess, review and recommend changes in policies, procedures that can help transform India’s education and skills scenario post-COVID19. Introduction It is an unprecedented situation, which the world of education has not witnessed before. The schools, colleges, universities and other professional institutions all are closed sine die. Millions of students are interned into their homes. The examinations were either partly held or have been called off. The admissions for the next academic session, which used to be a humongous exercise in the country is clearly in jeopardy. Similar uncertainty prevails with the competitive examinations – engineering, medical, CAT, MAT, ICAI, UPSC and state service commissions where millions of candidates used to appear for admissions in professional courses and prestigious jobs. Never before in the annals of human history such a disruption has been wrecked on the education system by a single threat. The education regulators, administrators, CBSE and state education boards are trying to grapple with the situation. The students’ population in India is very large and the education system is so diverse that the problem cannot be addressed by one remedy. With no end of the pandemic in sight, the days of classroom and face-to-face learning are supposedly over. Digital learning, learns’ facilitation and assessments are emerging as the new norms in the field of education. Skill education and training has been particularly affected. New trainees and the apprentices who ‘learn by doing’ under the supervision of a trainer or mentor in the laboratory or shop floor are particularly hamstrung. Various skilling programmes across the country involving thousands of training providers and millions of trainees have been stopped abruptly. Education and skill development are the pillars of an economy. This impasse cannot go on forever. Educationists, administrators and technical experts should find some via media to resume the teaching/ learning process. Emerging Challenges There is an old saying that, “Never let a good crisis go waste”. First and foremost, the challenge before the education system is to connect with the students and resume teaching and training activity. Given the scenario of lockdown and social distancing, it can be best achieved by adapting to the digital means of training delivery. Wherever, the assessments/ results have been stalled, we need to devise means to carry out the process digitally and declare the results. Digital education has the ability to fill in the gap, provided the IT infrastructure with the students, broadband connectivity and digital teaching platforms are available. 	Loss of jobs across the employment spectrum has taken place; affecting certain sectors adversely. If the lockdown is extended and the uncertainty regarding the easing of pandemic prevails more jobs will be lost. In coming months, the prospects of campus placements appear to be dim. The professional courses, aligned to those sectors, where the jobs have been cut will lose appeal amongst the students. Project-based and GIG economy jobs will gain ground as the employers will shun long-term commitment with the employees. While there is a pall of gloom hanging over the traditional jobs, the employment prospects in the high-end sectors such as virology, pharma, healthcare, data analytics, IOT, AI, machine learning, AR/VR/MR technologies, simulation, gaming, robotics, drone technology & application, GIS, 3D printing, etc. are likely brighten up. The COVID will will make millions of overseas education enthusiasts reluctant to go abroad for higher studies in wake of the devastation that has been witnessed in major developed countries. This will result in a huge demand for good quality of education and skills within India. Emerging Paradigms The COVID 19 outbreak has impacted not only the jobs but the education and skill development sector as well. The entire tertiary education system has come to a grinding halt. Feb-May is considered to be the examination season in India. Due to the lockdowns classes have been halted, examinations cancelled and the entire system from primary to university level continues to oscillate between hope and despair. Situation is grim and impregnated with long-term consequences for the education ecosystem. Lakhs of students have been displaced and their return is uncertain. The closure of campuses, laboratories and workshops and restricted movements have severely impacted research, associated field work and external research collaborations. Indian education system is culturally aligned to kinaesthetic learning and teaching; with the physical classroom as an inseparable part. The parents drew immense satisfaction and pride by sending their children to schools and colleges. The pandemic has changed the perspective of education by disrupting the stereotype and introducing virtual education as an alternative. The quality of infrastructure in our education system in terms of digitisation and broadband support is still very basic. Some of the city-based schools, colleges and universities were quick to shift on to digital teaching platforms with A/V options. Students from lower classes are also being introduced to digital learning platforms to attend classes from the confines of their homes. For the students and parents, it is a new learning experience. The experiment, albeit on a limited scale, holds promise as an alternate strategy for education. However, poor infrastructure continues to play truant. In the coming days, given the pandemic’s virulence, the parents may prefer home-based education for their wards until the risk subsides. Digitally delivered tuitions are expected to see an increased demand. Even when the schools and colleges reopen, the fear of COVID and social distancing requirements will impact the attendance of the students. Distance education and open schooling, if aligned to the new realities, may find many students opting for it. The syllabuses might shrink to pave way for micro-learning as the students would prefer short skill oriented learning modules. The pandemic has made a damaging impact on many developed countries including USA, UK, Germany, Japan and Australia, which used to attract the Indian students for higher learning. The students may not prefer to go to these countries at least in the near future. This will again result in a huge surge in demand for quality education and capacity expansion in the country. The emerging paradigm poses more questions than it answers. India has a large number of teachers, who are at present sitting at home. How can they resume teaching? Their ability to work through the digital platforms for training delivery needs to be developed through skills gap analysis and quick skilling. Our teaching methods, pedagogy, contents, learning and assessments are yet to align with digital processes. The demand for the subject matter experts who can teach via digital platforms; write digitally aligned teaching content; prepare digital platforms and applications and facilitate the learning process in any other manner will surge. Perhaps these will be a prerequisite for the success of any alternate training strategy. The Way Forward: Ensure Business Continuity Role of the Regulators The Coronavirus due to its high infection rate and consequent mortality shall continue to haunt mankind. Unless and until a vaccine for COVID 19 is found, normal functioning of educational institutions shall remain a distant dream. A successful education and skilling strategy shall span over all the phases of the pandemic – lockdown; eased restriction and post-COVID. Business continuity is an immediate challenge. The education regulators must evaluate the impact of the pandemic and take a pragmatic view to ensure resumption of teaching activities. As it is going to be a long drawn affair, there is a need to act in short-term but also plan for the long-term. We may have to break the old paradigms and take some disruptive decisions. As digital learning will gain prominence, a proper guideline can be issued for a structured digital learning process for mentoring of the students for the projects, thesis, dissertations besides specific coaching sessions for laboratories and workshops related requirements. For the immediate and short-term (Academic Year 2020-21) the examination ordinances may require some changes, wherein institutions can opt for either online or offline examinations or a blend of both. Reduction of duration of examination can be achieved by introducing an open book system and project-based assessments. This change will augment the need for innovative and effective methods for assessments. The examination and assessment of students can be further technologically enabled while keeping both the channels (offline and online) in mind. Specialists in this field will have a big demand to work with content specialists and SMEs to develop customised assessments, simulations, games that can enhance learning by taking and testing knowledge to application. Shifting to digital platforms would require institutions to assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organizations or individuals. Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students’ data privacy, secrecy and sanctity of any examination or learning process. University Grants Commission Regulation of Minimum Standards 2003 guidelines must be reviewed and compulsion of 180 days for class/ laboratory training should be relaxed so that online activities can be increased by the institutions. A committee of experts must be constituted to make a Digital Learning Policy. The virtual laboratories, simulations, contact classes, group learnings, project-based activities must be incorporated in the new policy. The regulators should consider making digital learning flexible and not restrict it to 20 percent. The future will see more impetus on digital, distance and open schooling and hence regulators must make disruptive or innovative changes in the entire education policy. The government needs to formulate a plan for all schools, small or big, private or government to have a “Fusion Model of Learning” where regular, open and distance models see convergence and integration. Open Schooling and Distance Learning can become an integrated part of future alternate learning without any stigma attached to it. The new partnership of academia and industry needs to be forged and a renewed focus on building start-up and entrepreneurial mindset needs to be ignited through education and skill development. A clear cut policy accepting the new norms regarding a structured digital learning/ teaching/ assessment process through digital mode and related changes in the pedagogy, syllabus, contents and assessment tools would be required from the regulators to ensure uniformity of methods and application. The government must also explore how Doordarshan can become an mode of school, higher education and skill based learning in the current situation, to address the challenges of connectivity and those people who are unable to access internet. Institutions’ Role Every university or institution must call their Board of Studies, Academic Councils/ Skill Councils to review the curriculum for all the programmes and map the digital and virtual content where possible to make the overall course structure more blended in nature. At the school levels, while introducing and shifting to new technological platforms, it is important to mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers and students with each other. Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated. Organize brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed. As and when the institutions reopen, social distancing will be the norm. It will reduce the number of students in each class by half. So, the requirement of classrooms will double, affecting the overall cost of education, to be borne by the parents. The classes can be planned in two shifts. Institutes should also think about some alternate model of revenue generation, for example, multi-purpose use of existing infrastructure and resources. The educational institutions may face a fiscal challenge as their revenue collections dip. Resource crunch and reduced enrolments would further aggravate their financial stability. We may see many institutions going out of business. A large number of teaching professionals may also lose their jobs. It will impact the overall educational infrastructure of the country. The institutions should also assess the loss of teaching hours and plan to make it up through organising special classes on weekends, vacations and holidays. Digital classes can be organised on flexible timings keeping in mind the availability of the students. Institutional collaborations to leverage higher and better returns on technological investments and interventions will help institutions to keep the costs at minimum while maximizing value for the learners. Role of the Stakeholders Education ecosystem has many stakeholders – students, teachers, assessors, parents, government, subject matter experts, etc. Initially, changed paradigm and methods may not convince everyone. Teachers, assessors and subject matter experts must be convinced about the efficacy of digital methods of teaching. The parents, who are so used to the previous ‘chalk and talk’ model will need counselling and convincing about the new system. The parents must be taken on board, because they are an important stakeholder. Due to the prevailing upheaval, the students are an anxious lot. Their every query needs to be heard and answered patiently. Through repeated counselling and hand-holding we can introduce the students to the new model.  The students may need infrastructural support in terms of broadband connectivity, availability of android phones, tablets, laptop computers to be able to participate in the new learning process. The anxiety levels of the students need to be handled by trained counsellors. The institutions must create a pool of skilled counsellors who can address the concerns amongst the youths and inculcate positivity. Resumption of Skill Education and Training The exodus of inter-state migrant workers back to their homes has led to a dual challenge for the governments. The workers back in their villages will be out of the job. The industries and other work areas will face an acute shortage of workers. Skilling, reskilling of migrant workers in the villages to enhance their livelihood options and new workers to fill the void in the industrial areas will emerge as priority as the industries resume operations. The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), Sector Skill Councils (SSC), State Skill Missions and Skill institutions will be required to devise a new strategy with an aim to ‘Reprioritize Skills’ to align to the new demand and supply requirements. A quick skill demand mapping shall be required to identify emerging job-roles, post pandemic. The existing skill training partner model would need to be reviewed to include digital methodologies on priority. The training partners – old or new, who possess such subject matter expertise would be preferred for empanelment. The existing skilling regulations and norms set by the government and the training infrastructure requirement would need tweaking to accommodate new realities. As skill-based programmes largely draw students from rural belts, the challenge of trainees’ mobilization and attendance will have to be dealt with. Shifting of skill training to digital platforms will face the dual challenge of availability of digital devices and internet connectivity. The success of the model would largely depend upon skill upgradation and orientation of trainers, students and assessors to use the digital platforms effectively. The regulators need to make relevant changes in the Apprenticeship Act to accommodate online/ blended/ virtual learning. A committee of experts from all stakeholders must examine the pros and cons and formulate a policy on introducing virtual or blended learning as a qualifier for apprenticeship. The new rules may allocate more responsibilities for the industries and on-site supervisors to ensure deployment of apprentices on the shop floor through digital mode. The apprentice who is trained through this new scheme will receive virtual certification and allowed to work without supervision. Focus on Job Creation The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) and NSDC need to bring a special and differentiated focus on the start-up and entrepreneurship training that promotes livelihood at sub-district levels. As the jobs in future may shrink, focussing on agro-based jobs and skilling can address post-COVID livelihood challenges. Farmer Producer Company model (FPC) is the need of the hour. Access to small credit and unhindered market connect can rejuvenate the local agro-based livelihood opportunities. A Cooperative Corporate model that encompasses various interwoven opportunities to create an attractive and satisfying rural living assumes importance in engaging rural youth meaningfully. A rural leadership programme must be started by the MSDE for all the youngsters in rural belts incorporating traditional Bhartiya practices with value- based leadership and digital and financial modelling that helps to develop home based enterprises. Cooperative Corporates must encompass all aspects of rural livelihood and integrate it with urban economic structures. The government and organisations need to explore ways to help the emerging GIG workers by introducing suitable policies and schemes. The companies may relook at the terms of employment wherein regular, part time, flexible jobs are integrated with GIG jobs. The compensation can be planned accordingly. The GIG workforce must be included in the social security and healthcare schemes of the government. The existing schemes of the Government of India (Start-up, Jan Dhan, Micro Financing etc.) must be reviewed to incorporate informal workers. With many industries and organizations planning to pull out of China, India may get favourable attention. Therefore it is important to predict which new skills will emerge out of global front that will require us to plan in advance and train our resources  for new emerging technologies and job roles. Public private partnership in the areas of developing applications, digital platforms, learning resources and contents for training delivery, monitoring, assessment and post-training tracking should be explored nationally and internationally. Preparing for the New Normal While the knowledge component can be delivered easily to the trainees using digital platforms, the challenge is to ensure that it is translated into application by teachers and trainers using innovative pedagogy blended with experiential learning. This would require reorienting teachers and trainers to the distance and digital learning models from traditional teaching methods. For skilling of learners, in vocational and skill development two main training methods - “Off-the-Job Training” and “On-the-Job Training” play an important role. The success of skill education in future would depend on how effectively a trainer is able to blend these two.  Training of teachers on various technologies and tools will be an important driver to make this shift successful. The teachers need to be oriented on the fundamentals and principles of Work From Home (WFH). The WFH requires an even more regulated regime and certain Do’s and Don’ts have to be followed. Improving the technical threshold of teachers with reference to various tools, features and applications of digital platforms would be required to make learning effective. The traditional teaching and skilling practices will seldom align to the new norms of virtual learning. Keeping the students engaged and motivated for learning would be a challenge. This requires teachers to be upskilled for planning their classes remotely besides learning how to engage students in groups, leverage video-based teaching, and carry out online live assessments. The options of recorded sessions to be sent to students can help those who might have missed the session for various reasons. In order to make digital transition successful, the teachers and trainers need to be trained on new and advanced features of digital technologies that helps them in customising their learning resources for digital platforms, for example, how to develop caselets, role plays, project-based assignments, group learnings, shared learnings, community-based learnings, collaborative learnings and cross cultural connects, that can be effectively administered digitally besides the usage of features e.g Using digital discussion or breakaway rooms,  digital polls, chat boards. The teachers need to be trained to reimage the learning needs in the changed environment and be able to deliver that The students would also need orientation towards digital learning. Their gainful engagement and participation will reflect on their attendance in the class. Institutions, and faculties must from time to time orient and reorient students besides seeking feedback to make digital learning a two-way channel. Like the WFH for teachers, every institution must prepare and share guidelines for Study from Home for the students. The institutions, universities and NSDC through their Board of Studies need to review the Qualification Packs (QPs) and curriculums for the various programmes for their suitability for delivery - online, virtual or blended learning methods. Infrastructural Improvement The government will have to play a big role in making sure the internet speed and connectivity issues are addressed. Government’s policy on the internet and broad band to provide free access to the students and teaching communities to 4G network would be a great enabler. A special scheme can be introduced for the students pursuing skill education and training courses, to provide them with android phones, tablets, laptop computers free of cost or on easy instalments, which can be recovered from them once their job or livelihood starts. Skill Ecosystem In this hour of pandemic where the active classroom for training and skilling are shifting to virtual mode, the Ministry of Skill Development should change the current training norms and introduce a new norm where dual mode of Industry integrated skilling is incentivised. The new norms should allow any industry to partner with local Missions and enrol its new joining workmen into a specific skill development program through a virtual skilling model as per defined hours. The new norms may grant credits to the work as well as provide teaching through a virtual mode on weekend and self pace mode. For all the certified candidates, the industry shall be reimbursed a portion out of the common norms cost. This will become a Win Win for all the stakeholders. NSDC, SSCs and skill institutions need to rope in digital content developers and technologists to create experiential learning content for every job role. The SSCs should also explore available digital contents with various countries and make it available in local Indian languages. This should be integrated with virtual laboratory solutions, and other means of pedagogical interventions that facilitate knowledge to application concept. The MSDE, NSDC and SSCs need to adopt new learning cycles, pedagogies, content changes, that will incorporate virtual and blended learning and therefore a review of the Common Norms would be highly desirable. The cost norms, the infrastructure norms, payment norms, certification process for both teacher and student need to be revised keeping the innovation and disruption costs. The new norms for assessments need to be introduced incorporating the digital and virtual options. Conclusion We are unsure how the post-COVID scenario would unfold; but it is very unlikely that things will ever return to pre-COVID days. Our workplaces, social interactions, business interactions, personal and public life are likely to see a drastic change. Emotional intelligence will be an important skill set for the future. The art of staying calm in all circumstances will be the key for survival in an unpredictable and surprising environment. All learners need to be skilled now for a lifelong learning process. The curriculum at all levels must include adaptability, embracing challenge, collaborative thinking, cross cultural learning, creativity and critical thinking skills besides digital skills. The convergence of syllabus, resources, digital platforms, and credit sharing can be seen as a transformative method of blended options of learning at all levels. The future will see melting of physical boundaries of educational institutions and a more collaborative and a disruptive autonomy amongst higher educational institutions. This will pave the way for a new concept of ‘anywhere, anytime and from anyone’ learning. A policy to let institutions collaborate with each other, use each other’s resources, infrastructure, strengths and a freedom and flexibility to students can prove to be a transformation. In the short term even the quarantine period of migratory labourers and interested people can be used for digital upskilling. The schools and colleges converted to quarantine centres can be also used for skilling and training. The Centre and State governments should constitute a task force comprising all stakeholders to assess, review and recommend changes in policies, procedures that can help nation to handle the post-COVID scenario, that promotes appreciation for an interconnected world where we see everyone as a part of one common human family and work for the betterment of mankind in the spirit of “Sarve Bhavantu Sukhina”. In order to decide what kind of education we need post COVID 19, Bharat has to decide what kind of India we want.

'Country of Origin' to be mandatorily mentioned by sellers on Government e-Marketplace; Move to promote Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat, 23-Jun-2020,,"Government e-Marketplace (GeM), a Special Purpose Vehicle under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, has made it mandatory for sellers to enter the Country of Origin while registering all new products on GeM says a PIB press release. Further, sellers, who had already uploaded their products before the introduction of this new feature on GeM, are being reminded regularly to update the Country of Origin, with a warning that their products shall be removed from GeM if they fail to update the same. GeM has taken this significant step to promote ‘Make in India’ and ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’. GeM has also enabled a provision for indication of the percentage of local content in products. With this new feature, now, the Country of Origin as well as the local content percentage are visible in the marketplace for all items. More importantly, the ‘Make in India’ filter has now been enabled on the portal. Buyers can choose to buy only those products that meet the minimum 50% local content criteria. In case of Bids, Buyers can now reserve any bid for Class I Local suppliers (Local Content > 50%). For those Bids below INR 200 crore, only Class I and Class II Local Suppliers (Local content > 50% and > 20% respectively) are eligible to bid, with Class I supplier getting purchase preference.  The recent stand-off at Galwan valley between Indian Army and Chinese occupationist forces had increased the calls for boycott of Chinese products after the Chinese forces brutally killed 20 Indian army soldiers. The supreme sacrifice of Indian soldiers led to demands of mentioning the country of origin on every product so that the buyer can decide whether to buy the product or not.  Indian consumers are also demanding that online e-Market places like Amazong and Flipkart too mention the country of Origin on each product sold on their sites.  Government e-Marketplace (GeM)  Since its inception, GeM is continuously working towards promotion of ‘Make in India’ initiative.  The Marketplace has facilitated entry of small local sellers in Public Procurement, while implementing ‘Make in India’ and MSE Purchase Preference Policies of the Government in the true sense. GeM is enabling quick, efficient, transparent and cost-effective procurement, especially in this hour of need when government organizations require products and services urgently to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. The purchases through GeM by Government users have been authorised and made mandatory by Ministry of Finance by adding a new Rule No. 149 in the General Financial Rules, 2017.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/23/Country-of-Origin-to-be-mandatorily-mentioned-by-sellers-on-Government-e-Marketplace.html
"‘Sure, pure and secure’: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates Asia’s largest solar plant in Madhya Pradesh’s Rewa", 11-Jul-2020,,"PM said Solar energy will be a medium of energy needs of the 21st century because solar power is sure, pure and secure. PIB Delhi: The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi dedicated to the Nation the Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Power project to the Nation via video conference today. It is Asia's largest power project. Speaking on the occasion the Prime Minister said the Rewa project will make the entire region a major hub for pure and clean energy in this decade. The Prime Minister praised the effort in that it will also supply power to the Delhi Metro, along with the entire region surrounding Rewa. He said very soon Madhya Pradesh would be the main centre of Solar Energy in India, as such major projects are in progress in  Neemuch, Shajapur, Chattarpur and Omkareshwar. The biggest beneficiaries of this would be the poor, the middle class, the tribals, the farmers of Madhya Pradesh, he said. Prime Minister said Solar Energy would be a major medium for providing the energy needs of an aspirational India in the 21st Century. He described Solar Energy as one which is ‘Sure, Pure & Secure’. Sure because of the continuous supply of Energy from the Sun, Pure as it is environment friendly and Secure because it is a secure source for our energy needs. Prime Minister termed such Solar Energy projects are a true representation of Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India). He said the economy is an important aspect of self-reliance and progress. Referring to the regular dilemma whether to focus on Economy or Ecology, Prime Minister said India resolved such dilemmas by focussing on Solar Energy Projects and other environment friendly measures. Shri modi said Economy and Ecology are not contradictory but complementary to each other. He said in all the programs of the government, priority is being given to environmental protection as well as Ease of Living. He referred to programmes like Swachch Bharat, supply of LPG cylinders to the poor households, the development of CNG networks as one which focussed on Ease of Living and improving the lives of the poor and the middle class. The Prime Minister said that the protection of the environment is not limited to just a few projects, but it is the Way of Life. PM said it is ensured that the determination towards clean energy is seen in every aspect of life, when launching large projects of renewable energy. Government is making sure that its benefits reach every corner of the country, every section of society, every citizen. He elaborated this with an example of how the introduction of LED bulbs has reduced the electricity bill. Nearly 40 million tons of carbon dioxide is prevented from going into the environment, due to the LED bulb. He said this also reduced the Electricity Usage by 6 Billion Units and accrued a saving of Rs 24,000 Crore to the exchequer. He said that the Government is working towards making our environment, our air, our water also to remain pure and this thinking is also reflected in the policy and strategy on solar energy. Shri Modi said India’s exemplary progress in the field of Solar Energy would be a major source of interest to the World. He said owing to such major steps, India is being considered as the most attractive market of clean energy. The Prime Minister said that the International Solar Alliance (ISA) was launched with the motive to unite the entire World in terms of solar energy. He said the spirit behind  was  One World, One Sun, One Grid. The Prime Minister expressed confidence that Madhya Pradesh's farmers will also make use of the Government’s KUSUM Program and will instal Solar Energy plants in their lands as an additional source of income. He expressed the hope that very soon India will be a major exporter of power. Prime Minister said India is also focussing reducing its dependence on imports of various hardware needed for solar plants, like Photovoltaic Cells, Battery and Storage. He said the work is progressing rapidly in this direction and the  Government is encouraging the Industry, the youth, MSMEs and StartUps to not miss this opportunity and work for production and betterment of all the inputs required for Solar Energy. Referring to the ongoing crisis owing to the pandemic COVID-19, the Prime Minister said for either the Government or the society, compassion and vigilance are the greatest motivators to tackle this difficult challenge. He said right from the beginning of the Lockdown the Government ensured that the poor and needy are assured of supply of food and fuel. He said with the same spirit, the Government decided to continue the free supply of food and LPG till November this year, even during the phase of unlockdown. Not only this, the government is also giving full contribution to the EPF account of millions of private sector employees. Similarly, through the PM-Swanidhi scheme, those who have the least access to the system get benefitted. He added that when people are moving out of their home to make Madhya Pradesh great, they should follow these rules - maintaining a distance of two yards, wearing a mask on the face and washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/11/Asia-s-largest-power-project-in-Rewa-dedicated-to-the-nation-by-PM-Narendra-Modi-via-video-conference.html
President of India donates to Army Hospital on Kargil Vijay Diwas: Funds to be used to procure air filtering equipment for Corona Warriors, 26-Jul-2020,,"As a tribute to soldiers who fought valiantly and made supreme sacrifice in the Kargil war, the President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind today (July 26, 2020) presented a cheque of Rs 20 lakh to the Army Hospital (Research and Referral), Delhi, to buy equipment that will help doctors and paramedics to combat the Covid-19 pandemic effectively. Today is the 21st anniversary of the Kargil war victory which is celebrated as Vijay Diwas. The President’s contribution to the Army Hospital has been made possible due to an exercise to economise expenditure in the Rashtrapati Bhavan and thus make more resources available to contain Covid-19. The President had earlier issued directions to reduce expenses by initiating a slew of measures in the Rashtrapati Bhavan. As a sequel to this initiative, he had earlier deferred the proposal to buy a limousine which was to be used for ceremonial occasions. The contribution from the President to the Army Hospital will be used to procure units of PAPR (powered air purifying respirator), which are state-of-art equipment to enable medical professionals breathe during surgeries and protect them from infection. This will serve the larger cause of patients’ care and protection to those warriors who are fighting an invisible enemy. In his role as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, the President’s gesture will boost the morale of the frontline Covid Warriors of the Army Hospital. It will go a long way in providing a safe, conducive environment to them so that they can perform to the best of their ability. It is also hoped that the gesture will inspire other people and organisations to economise expenditure and utilise the savings to aid and support our Covid warriors. The Army Hospital (Research and Referral) is the apex medical care centre for the Armed Forces of India. The Officiating Commandant Maj. Gen. Sarat Chandra Dash was also a participant in OP VIJAY for which he was awarded Yudh Seva Medal. In the prevailing situation, its doctors, nurses and paramedical staff are tirelessly working round the clock and providing the highest quality of medical care at great risk to their own lives.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/26/President-of-India-donates-to-Army-Hospital-on-Vijay-Diwas.html
Reforms in India and reshaping the world order post Covid19, 16-Jul-2020,- Amita Apte,"Indian talent is helping not only India but the world to get over this never seen before situation of pandemic, not only in the sector of health care but also economics. The world is recognising the persistent efforts of Indian professionals like doctors, nurses, bankers, lawyers, scientists, teachers, laborers, technological professionals, etc. who are working tirelessly to help and save the people within and out side the country. India Inc. UK had organised a 3 day international seminar #BeTheRevival in which more than 30k people from more than 70 countries participated online. The speeches and interviews of prominent leaders like PM Modi, S. Jaishankar, Piyush Goyal, Ravishankar Prasad, Yogi Adityanath, JnK Governor Mr. Murmu were the highlights of the summit. Shri shri Ravishankar and Sadguru were also interviewed. Indian Prime minister Modi, in his inaugural speech stated that after moulting its old image, the new reformed India is gearing up to take every challenge which will make it more competent, vibrant, resilient and matured. Supported with cutting edge technology, Indian businesses are setting new modules which are eco friendly yet sustainable, price-effective and consumer oriented. This new dimension is a must for the survival of mankind on the surface of Mother earth. International business world is gradually acknowledging it. The world is now entering the phase of revival, post Covid. Indian talent is helping not only India but the world to get over this never seen before situation of pandemic, not only in the sector of health care but also economics. The world is recognising the persistent efforts of Indian professionals like doctors, nurses, bankers, lawyers, scientists, teachers, laborers, technological professionals, etc. who are working tirelessly to help and save the people within and out side the country. India is already supplying Covid drugs and other essentials to 120 countries. The way, India is fighting with Corona, bringing in new reforms, setting new targets, using this time to introspect and transform itself for the new future is commendable. India, being one of the youngest countries, is full of enthusiasm, leading-edge technological innovations and professionalism. India’s ability to reform and rejuvenate is unquestionable. In spite of so many attacks on it’s people, civilisations and philosophy it has always bounced back with much more vigour and vitality.This pandemic is no different. These Soft powers of ancient Indian knowledge of Yog, Ayurved, meditation etc. have helped billions of people worldwide. In these testing times of scarcity, uncertainty and non-cooperation within countries, India provided medical aids to many developing countries as a grant. Even the periodical bans on exports of medicines, PPE kits etc. were to ensure steady flow of these materials to all the countries no matter how small or poor the country is. This well-thought and well-planned export policy is much appreciated all over the world and obviously increasing the goodwill and the trust in Indian business ethos. ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat’ does not mean, we are closing ourselves from the world, but in fact, it's just the opposite of that. We want to get acquainted with the world on our terms. We want to be self reliant and self-sufficient. Indian government is making Indian economy more productive, investment friendly and competitive. Corruption free working modules are adopted scraping old, lengthy corruption oriented systems. Even the last man in the economic hierarchy can now contribute to the 'making of India'. Indian government is making arrangements to launch one of the world's largest work programs to provide employment to millions of workers once the economy unlocks. This will give a booster to the rural economy providing durable infrastructure to rural India. India is welcoming all the multinational foreign companies to invest and establish their realms in different sectors of the economy. There are great opportunities in the agricultural sector that can ensure win-win offers to both the company and the farmers. Indian farm produce has been waiting for facilities like logistics and storage for a long time now. There is immense opportunity in the food-processing industry. MSME is also one of the most lucrative areas for the foreign investors. One of the biggest armies in the world is inviting foreign businesses to produce for them. Digital business has opened up an entirely new world of possibilities to dive into. Very recently Google has announced US$ 10 Bn investments in India. Just imagine how much employment this one deal will generate. During this pandemic, Indian pharma sector has proved itself an asset to the world. This sector is also quite unexplored as yet. Vaccines produced in India, support 2 out of 3 children’s health care needs worldwide. We are working with internationally recognised labs to find the vaccine for Covid-19. Once found, we will play a leading role in production and distribution of this vaccine in minimum costs especially for developing countries. As we are already the world’s largest producer of vaccines, in terms of accessibility, affordability and availability we will be proved equally competent to the challenge. Many deals are underway with the United Nations. India already partners with the US, France, Israel, UK, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, China, Japan and many other countries in defence, trade, food supply, service sector, science, technology, space, telecommunications, AI and other important sectors. ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat’ does not mean, we are closing ourselves from the world, but in fact, it's just the opposite of that. We want to get acquainted with the world on our terms. We want to be self reliant and self-sufficient. Let’s take an example. Indian tech businesses want to innovate new technologically advanced products. They want to own IPs.They are not satisfied with getting the contract only to produce or assemble any more. Indian Pharma sector wants to own and produce APIs. They are not satisfied with producing drugs using imported APIs. Many players in space technology want to try new things using indigenous hi-tech innovations. India has already proved its mettle in this field. Now the government is opening the space sector to private players also. Power sector is changing gears and many private players are kicking off to produce clean, green and renewable energy like solar power plants. Now is the time for India to define and dictate the terms. We can quote many such examples from almost every sector of the economy. Indian Government is equally enthusiastic and ready to extend support to Indian business world to achieve these targets. New reforms in labour laws, changed policies regarding FDIs are some of the latest developments in this direction. In all, India is breaking the boundaries of it’s past image making ‘reform, perform and transform’ it’s new Mantra. And above all, the young age of India, Indian talent and vast Indian markets are some of the most important key factors in attracting foreign businesses and investments in Indian lands. These times are known to be the best times to invest in India. When many countries are minimising their stakes in Chinese lands and trying to sow their money in different portfolios in more countries than one India seems to be the best option. But some people seem to love staying in denial. Well! They have every right to be so, in democracy.! They were in the same mode when the historic decision on Ram Janmabhoomi temple was made; when triple Talak was banned, when Articles 370 and 35A were scrapped, when JnK and Ladakh were made 2 separate UTs, Reservations to poor open category were provided. They only keep cribbing while millions of families are taking advantage of the decisions like GST, Ujwala gas Yojana, Ayushman bharat, Clean India, green India, Make in India, clean energy, Jandhan Yojana, etc. Fundamental shifts and reforms in India in last six years have helped Indian society to fight such inconceivably disastrous times. Around 80 crore people are getting the benefits of free ration for 6 months during the period of lockdown. Crores of Indians are receiving cash in their Jan Dhan Accounts from the government. Lakhs of migrant workers have been transported to their homes safely till today. Hence, when India is emerging as a new super power and taking the leadership in Asian region, 130 crore Indian citizens are taken into consideration and this democratically chosen people’s government is relentlessly working to make the crisis, India’s turn to rise and shine.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/16/Reforms-in-India-and-reshaping-the-world-order-post-Covid19.html

Atmanirbhar Bharat: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announces ban on 101 defence import items to boost 'self-reliance', 09-Aug-2020,,"Artillery guns, light combat helicopter, assault rifles, corvettes, radars, wheeled Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs), transport aircraft, and other high technology weapons are among the 101 defence items that will not be imported from now on, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced on Sunday. Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said that India is now ready for the big push to the atma nirbhar or self-dependent initiative announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The Ministry of Defence is now ready for a big push to #AtmanirbharBharat initiative. MoD will introduce import embargo on 101 items beyond given timeline to boost indigenisation of defence production,” Singh announced on Twitter. “Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi has given a clarion call for a self-reliant India based on the five pillars, i.e., Economy, Infrastructure, System, Demography & Demand and announced a special economic package for Self-Reliant India named ‘Atamnirbhar Bharat’,” he further said in the series of tweets. The defence minister said that taking a cue from PM Modi’s evocation, the defence ministry has prepared a list of 101 items for which there would be an embargo on the import beyond the timeline indicated against them. “This is a big step towards self-reliance in defence,” he said on Twitter. “This decision will offer a great opportunity to the Indian defence industry to manufacture the items in the negative list by using their own design and development capabilities or adopting the technologies designed & developed by DRDO to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces,” said Singh. The defence minister said that the list of 101 items has been prepared by the defence minister after several rounds of consultations with all stakeholders, including the armed forces, public and private industry. “Almost 260 schemes of such items were contracted by the Tri-Services at an approximate cost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore between April 2015 and August 2020. It is estimated that contracts worth almost Rs 4 lakh crore will be placed upon the domestic industry within the next 6 to 7 years,” Singh tweeted. “The list of 101 embargoed items comprises of not just simple parts but also some high technology weapon systems like artillery guns, assault rifles, corvettes, sonar systems, transport aircrafts, LCHs, radars and many other items to fulfil the needs of our Defence Services,” his tweet further said. Singh said that the embargo on imports is planned to be progressively implemented between 2020 to 2024. “Our aim is to apprise the Indian defence industry about the anticipated requirements of the Armed Forces so that they are better prepared to realise the goal of indigenisation.”",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/9/Atmanirbhar-Bharat.html

Rebooting India’s Nuclear Doctrine - Time to Rescind the No First Use Policy in the nation’s Nuclear Doctrine, 24-Aug-2020,- Nikhil Gowda,"We must begin by exploring how the NFU policy has become a limitation on India’s deterrence capability against the threats posed by Pakistan, China, and other non-state actors. (The article is reproduced from the author's post at  Twenty-two years ago, on 11 May 1998, India conducted a set of five nuclear tests in Pokhran that comprised of one fusion bomb and four fission bombs under the name Operation Shakti. Shortly after the success of these tests, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared India as a full-fledged nuclear state. The global world order condemned the nuclear tests which evoked sanctions from some countries including USA and Japan, who suspended all forms of economic aid to India. The challenge before India was to generate acceptance as a responsible nuclear power. Therefore, the government came out with its nuclear doctrine in 2003, the components of which can be summarised as follows (Nuclear Doctrine of India, 2003): 1. Building and maintaining a credible minimum deterrent; 2. A posture of “No First Use (NFU)”: nuclear weapons will only be used in retaliation against a nuclear attack on Indian territory or on Indian forces anywhere; 3. Nuclear retaliation to a first strike will be massive and designed to inflict unacceptable damage. 4. Nuclear retaliatory attacks can only be authorised by the civilian political leadership through the Nuclear Command Authority. 5. Non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states; 6. However, in the event of a major attack against India, or Indian forces anywhere, by biological or chemical weapons, India will retain the option of retaliating with nuclear weapons; 7. A continuance of strict controls on export of nuclear and missile related materials and technologies, participation in the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty negotiations, and continued observance of the moratorium on nuclear tests. 8. Continued commitment to the goal of a nuclear weapon free world, through global, verifiable and non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament The Nuclear doctrine was an attempt to gain legitimacy as a responsible nuclear power.  One can say that the doctrine has been able to meet the challenge – as presently most countries recognise India as a responsible nuclear power.  This can be validated by the India-USA nuclear agreement of 2005, an offer which the USA has not made to any other non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Strobe Talbott – an American Foreign Policy Analyst – has argued in his memoirs that US considers India’s Nuclear doctrine as proof for India being as a responsible nuclear power. In 2015, likewise, Japan & India signed a memorandum of understanding for Civil-Nuclear Co-operation overcoming the reservations over India’s status as a nation which has not signed NPT. However, questions have been raised consistently about the rationale behind NFU Policy by political leaders such as former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, the current Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, and strategic experts such as Bharat Karnad, in light of India’s national security considerations. Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) holds good only between two nation states, and doesn’t deter non-state actors such as terror groups from using nuclear weapons. Bharat Karnad, a prominent strategic expert, has argued that the NFU policy is not useful because a nuclear weapon cannot be designed only for a second strike. Secondly, the NFU posture would make sense only when a country has extremely high survival chance from first strike, and then has sufficient resources for a retaliatory strike. Karnad, therefore, argues for abandoning a policy of no first use. Even in 1998 when the National Security Board was debating on the draft nuclear doctrine, some members had openly argued against NFU Policy.  However, the debate was settled in favor of NFU given the realities at that time. Today, given the changing security scenario in South Asia, there is view that the NFU is a compromise on India’s security, which faces a perpetual threat from the two nuclear-armed neighbouring countries of  Pakistan & China. With recent aggressive incursions by China at Galwan valley, calls for strategic policymakers, to rethink over the relevance of NFU policy in India’s nuclear doctrine. Limitations Imposed by NFU Policy We must begin by exploring how the NFU policy has become a limitation on India’s deterrence capability against the threats posed by Pakistan, China, and other non-state actors.  Since both India and Pakistan went on to become nuclear-power states, we see that unlike India, Pakistan doesn’t endorse NFU of nuclear weapons which has helped Pakistan to overcome the edge that India possesses in terms of conventional military strength. Pakistan has successfully exploited India’s NFU policy through waging covert low intensity warfare such as militancy and infiltration, and any attempt for a conventional military response from India’s end has been stymied by Pakistan’s blackmail of a nuclear attack. This was witnessed in the case of Parliament attack in 2001 & Mumbai attack in 2008. The other important concern that India’s security faces is that, in recent years, many terror groups have been making attempts to access nuclear weapons. Matthew Bun – an American nuclear policy analyst – in his research has documented that Osama bin Laden had once said that acquiring nuclear & chemical weapons was a religious duty. Terror groups, such as Al-Qaeda, have made attempts to buy stolen nuclear material in their pursuit to make a nuclear weapon. According to US intelligence agencies shortly before the 9/11 attacks two Pakistani nuclear scientists who were extremist sympathizers met with Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to discuss about making a  nuclear weapon. Now, in a hypothetical situation, if one were to consider that Pakistan gives necessary support to these terror groups to access & use nuclear weapons against the Indian state, in such a scenario India will have to provide sufficient evidence to prove Pakistan’s involvement before undertaking any nuclear strike against Pakistan. The other important point that has to be noted is that the nuclear deterrence based on Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) holds good only between two nation states, and doesn’t deter non-state actors such as terror groups from using nuclear weapons. Hence, India should keep an open option of a preemptive strike. In China’s case, we see that, India’s NFU policy is futile in addressing the security challenges posed by Beijing, even though China was the first nuclear armed state to moot for an NFU policy. NFU shifts the balance in favor of China, as China has the edge over India, in terms of conventional military strength. According to Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index (which ranks countries based on military capabilities, economic resources & diplomatic influence) India lags behind China in every geopolitical metric. The disparity in conventional military capabilities between India & China has been widening over the years. For instance, China’s defense budget in year 2019 was $177.61 billion, whereas during same period, India’s defense budget has been valued at $66.9 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). We see that, Chinese defense budget is almost three times the size of India’s. India’s very own Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report has raised a red flag over India’s defense preparedness. For instance, India, at the current rate of defense procurement, could end up with only 22 squadrons, whereas Indian Air Force, needs 42 squadrons of jet, around 750 aircrafts to defend against a two-pronged attack from China & Pakistan. China nearly has one million more troops, five times more submarines and nearly twice as many warships than India. This shows that the conventional military power is heavily stacked in China’s favor, and India should device a strategy to deter a belligerent China along its border. Beijing’s post- Covid19 aggression, pressing for territorial claims from the great Himalayas to the South China Sea, provides an opportunity for India’s strategists to rethink NFU policy in its nuclear doctrine. Apprehensions raised by NFU Proponents Proponents of NFU have argued that any attempt to do away with the legacy of NFU policy would have negative impact on India’s image as a responsible nuclear power, which has been built over the years with great effort by the foreign policymakers, diplomats and which has yielded results in form of membership to global nuclear regimes such as Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), Wassenaar and Australian Group. Secondly, it would further raise the apprehensions of India’s smaller neighbors such as Nepal, Bhutan and strengthen the perception of India’s image as a big brother. However, these apprehensions are misplaced. One must understand that India’s image of a responsible nuclear power is not solely built on the NFU policy. It is based on other factors such as India impeccable track record with respect to non-proliferation,  and that the nuclear doctrine specifically mentions that India’s nuclear weapons will be never used against non-nuclear weapon states. Therefore, rescinding the NFU policy shouldn’t make the smaller  and non- nuclear states to cause to worry. Policy window is now open to rescind India’s NFU Beijing’s post- Covid19 aggression, pressing for territorial claims from the great Himalayas to the South China Sea, provides an opportunity for India’s strategists to rethink NFU policy in its nuclear doctrine. Today, the US along with the European countries has been critical of Beijing’s aggression in the neighborhood. On the other hand, New Delhi’s diplomacy has been successful to a certain extent in exposing Pakistan’s nexus with the terror groups, as well as using militancy as a tool to wage a low-intensity war against India in the recent Uri and Pathankot attacks, which also provides legitimacy to rescinding the NFU policy. The time is ripe for India to announce that the No First Use (NFU) policy in the doctrine would apply only to non-nuclear weapons state and keep the option open for a pre-emptive strike, in the case of nuclear-armed states. Domestically the conditions are favorable to the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government to review the utility of NFU policy, because it has a majority unlike the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime, which was tied down by the coalition compulsions. As a matter of fact, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had mentioned in its 2014 election manifesto, that it would study “in detail” India’s nuclear doctrine and to make it relevant to the challenges of current times. Conclusion The time is ripe for India to announce that the No First Use (NFU) policy in the doctrine would apply only to non-nuclear weapons state and keep the option open for a pre-emptive strike, in the case of nuclear-armed states. This would infuse a sense of realism into India’s nuclear doctrine given the fact that India is the only country in the world to share borders with two nuclear armed states. Rescinding the NFU policy would act as deterrent against Pakistan’s low-intensity warfare, and against the increasing Chinese aggression along the border. This brings  an element of  calculated ambiguity and surprise in the New Delhi’s nuclear posture, as even an ancient strategic scholar Kautilya exclaims  “Even when a snake is not poisonous, it should pretend to be venomous.” (The author  is a student of Master of Public Policy at the National Law School of India University.

NIA arrests ISIS operative working as an Ophthalmologist at a reputed Medical College in Bengaluru; Was developing medical and weaponry-related apps to help ISIS terrorists, 18-Aug-2020,,"(Image credit: NIA) The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested an ISIS operative in Bengaluru who was developing medical apps to help injured ISIS terrorists in conflict zones in Syria and other parts of West Asia. The arrested ISIS operative Abdur Rahman was working as an ophthalmologist Bengaluru’s M S Ramaiah Medical College which is one of the most reputed Medical colleges in the state. NIA in its press statement released earlier today said that Abdur Rahman was developing a medical application to help the injured ISIS cadres in the conflict-zones and a weaponry-related application for the benefit of ISIS fighters. The NIA also said that Rahman had even visited an ISIS medical camp in Syria in early 2014 for treatment of ISIS terrorists and stayed with Islamic State operatives for 10 days before returning to India. He stayed in a rented apartment in Basavanagudi in Bengaluru which is one of the oldest and peaceful areas of the city. NIA carried out searches at three premises belonging to him in Bangalore with the assistance of Karnataka Police and has seized digital devices, mobile phone, laptop containing incriminating material. He will be produced before the NIA Special Court at New Delhi and NIA remand will be sought for his custodial interrogation, the agency said. Rahman was arrested by NIA in connection with it's probe against the Kashmiri couple, Jahanzaib Sami Wani and Hina Bashir Beigh, who were arrested from Jamia Nagar in Delhi in March this year by the Delhi police. The couple was affiliated with the dreaded  Khorasan Module of the Islamic State. “They were also found to be in touch with Abdullah Basith, who was already lodged in Tihar jail in another NIA case (ISIS Abu Dhabi Module),” the NAI statement said. The NIA statement further said that the agency has arrested two more accused - Sadiya Anwar Sheikh and Nabeel Siddick Khatri from Pune based on their investigation in the same case.

"India joins US, Russia, China hypersonic Missile club: DRDO successfully tests Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle with indigenous system", 07-Sep-2020,,"In a boost to the mission of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has today successfully flight-tested the Hypersonic Technology Demonstrator Vehicle using the indigenously developed scramjet propulsion system. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh took to Twitter and congratulated DRDO for the success. ""With this success, all critical technologies are now established to progress to the next phase,"" Shri Rajnath Singh said. ""I congratulate to DRDO on this landmark achievement towards realising PM’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. I spoke to the scientists associated with the project and congratulated them on this great achievement. India is proud of them,"" Singh said in another tweet. ""It's a major technological breakthrough in the country. This testing paves the way for the development of more critical technologies, materials & hypersonic vehicles. This puts India in a selected club of nations who have demonstrated this technology,"" DRDO Chairman Dr G Satheesh Reddy said. The hypersonic cruise vehicle was launched using a proven solid rocket motor, which took it to an altitude of 30 kilometres (km), where the aerodynamic heat shields were separated at hypersonic Mach number. The cruise vehicle separated from the launch vehicle and the air intake opened as planned. The hypersonic combustion sustained and the cruise vehicle continued on its desired flight path at a velocity of six times the speed of sound i.e., nearly 02 km/second for more than 20 seconds. The critical events like fuel injection and auto ignition of scramjet demonstrated technological maturity. The scramjet engine performed in a textbook manner. The parameters of launch and cruise vehicle, including scramjet engine, was monitored by multiple tracking radars, electro-optical systems and Telemetry Stations. The scramjet engine worked at high dynamic pressure and at very high temperature. A Ship was also deployed in the Bay of Bengal to monitor the performance during the cruise phase of hypersonic vehicle. All the performance parameters have indicated a resounding success of the mission. With this successful demonstration, many critical technologies such as aerodynamic configuration for hypersonic manoeuvers, use of scramjet propulsion for ignition and sustained combustion at hypersonic flow, thermo-structural characterisation of high temperature materials, separation mechanism at hypersonic velocities etc. were proven. In June 2019, the defence agency had launched a technology demonstrator vehicle from Dr Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha. ""Various radars, telemetry stations and electro-optical tracking sensors tracked the vehicle through its course. The data has been collected and will be analysed to validate critical technologies,"" DRDO had said after the launch.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/7/DRDO-successfully-tests-Hypersonic-Technology-Demonstrator-Vehicle-with-indigenous-system.html

In the instant case on 07 September 2020, it was the PLA troops who were attempting to close-in with one of our forward positions along the LAC and when dissuaded by own troops, PLA troops fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate own troops. However, despite the grave provocation, own troops exercised great restraint and behaved in a mature and responsible manner,” the statement read.  “The Indian Army is committed to maintaining peace and tranquility, however is also determined to protect national integrity and sovereignty at all costs. The statement by the Western Theatre Command is an attempt to mislead their domestic and international audience,” it added. Early on Tuesday, China said that the border troops of its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) took “countermeasures” after the Indian Army crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and fired “warning shots” near the Pangong Tso.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/8/India-rebuts-China-s-allegations.html

"India's satellite communication systems safe, secure: ISRO chief", 23-Sep-2020,," US think-tank report says China mounted multiple cyber attacks on Indian systems Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief Shri K Sivan has said Indian Indian space systems are “safe and secure” and the space agency is capable to meet any challenge posed by external threats. “The threat perception is always there and it's not unique to India. We are secure,” he told TOI. Reacting to the US-based China Aerospace Studies Institute (CASI) report which suggested that China had mounted an attack against Indian satellite communications in 2017 through computer networks. According to Shri Sivan India has an independent and isolated network that is not connected to the public domain, which makes it safe. Other scientists also pointed out that there might have been external attacks and ISRO is fully equipped to meet the challenge. “Cyber threats are a given but it cannot be ascertained who are behind such attacks. We have systems in place to alert us and I don't think we have ever been compromised. The Chinese may have tried and failed,” said a senior scientist associated with the space agency. According to media reports, China had carried out multiple cyber attacks between 2012 and 2018. The CASI report says the Chinese mounted cyber attack against India's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ISRO has been a target of attacks by rival space agencies and countries inimical to India. It is a well-known fact that a fake spy case was foisted against a top ISRO scientist to defeat India's cryogenic research. The controversy had adversely affected India's progress in the research for some time.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/23/India-s-satellite-communication-systems-safe-secure.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi calls upon G20 countries to come out with a concrete action plan to fight COVID 19, 27-Mar-2020,,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called on G-20 leaders to help usher in a new globalization for the collective well-being of humankind and have multilateral for a focus on promoting shared interests of humanity. In his address at Virtual G-20 Leaders’ Summit last night, Shri Narendra Modi underscored the need to put human beings at the centre of vision of global prosperity and cooperation. He also stressed the importance of freely and openly sharing the benefits of medical research and development, developing adaptive, responsive and humane health care systems, and promoting new crisis management protocols. The extraordinary Virtual G20 Leaders’ Summit was convened on 26 March 2020 to discuss the challenges posed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and to forge a global coordinated response. Earlier, the Prime Minister had a telephonic conversation with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia on this subject. The extraordinary G20 Summit was a culmination of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting and G20 Sherpas Meeting on the COVID-19 pandemic. At the meeting, G20 Leaders agreed to take all necessary measures to contain the pandemic and protect people. They also supported strengthening of the WHO’s mandate in the fight against pandemics, including delivery of medical supplies, diagnostic tools, treatments, medicines and vaccines. Leaders also committed to use all available policy tools to minimize the economic and social cost of the pandemic and to restore global growth, market stability and strengthening resilience. G20 countries committed to inject over USD 5 trillion into the global economy to counter the social and economic impact of COVID-19. Leaders also agreed to contribute to the WHO led COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund on a voluntary basis. Prime Minister Modi thanked the King of Saudi Arabia for convening this extraordinary session of G20. In his remarks, PM noted the alarming social and economic cost of the pandemic, He added that 90% of the COVID-19 cases and 88% of deaths were in G20 countries even as they share 80% of world GDP and 60% of world population. He called on the G20 to come out with a concrete action plan to fight the global pandemic. PM underscored the need to put human beings at the centre of our vision of global prosperity and cooperation, freely and openly share the benefits of medical research and development, develop adaptive, responsive and humane health care systems, promote new crisis management protocols and procedures for an interconnected global village, strengthen and reform intergovernmental organisations like WHO and work together to reduce economic hardships resulting from COVID-19 particularly for the economically weak.

Brave India Leadsfrom the Front, 29-Mar-2020,,"Indians stranded in Wuhan being evacuated by an Air India aircraft Even as the world scrambles to put all defences to fight the Covid-19, or the Coronavirus pandemic, India’s response is worthy of appreciation and even gratitude On the tarmac of the Wuhan International Airport, the look of awe on the Chinese marshallers was quite visible, as an Air India aircraft touched down to airlift stranded Indians from Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicentre of Coronavirus outbreak. They must have been thinking which country will even do this? India, undoubtedly! Even as the world scrambles to put up all defences to fight the Covid-19 or the Coronavirus pandemic, India’s response is one worthy of appreciation and even gratitude. Let’s cover gratitude first. I am wondering if there is any other country that evacuated its citizens from Coronavirus flash points like India. India evacuated more than 700 citizens from the epicentre of Wuhan in the Hubei province. The Chinese government was enforcing strict lockdowns on the entire Hubei province. Amidst this, India’s diplomatic mission in Beijing had to painstakingly identify, trace, locate and then contact all Indians trapped in Hubei province. Then, our diplomats travelled on road to Wuhan and arranged for buses to be sent to different remote corners of the province to fetch the Indians. Similarly, India is evacuating hundreds of Indians trapped in Iran and bringing them back home safely. This time, to further speed up the process of isolation and rehabilitation, India is testing the stranded Indians in Iran itself. And the entire testing systems will be donated to Iran as a goodwill gesture to augment that country’s response. Iran is one of the worst-affected countries. While I am writing this article, 200 plus Indians are being rescued from northern Italy, the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy. The critics may dismiss it as a government duty and assert the need to show any gratitude, but we must understand that this is no mean feat. Otherwise, why didn’t most other countries rescue their citizens unlike we did? The kind of seamless coordination across diplomatic channels is unprecedented. Our government has to take permits from the host countries and their many layers of governance mechanism. This amidst a lockdown where the tendency of such machinery would be to heed less to concerns from other nations and first focus on the well being of the host nation’s citizens. However, this is not the first time. India has stood by its citizens in all kinds of crises and rescued them every time. Perhaps, only an Indian, in any corner of the world, can sleep peacefully that if he or she faces a problem tomorrow, the tri-colour and the Ashok Chakra will come to their rescue, no matter what! On the domestic front too, our healthcare workers are working on a war footing. 1,229,363 passengers have been screened from 11,406 flights at the 30 designated airports. In response to a British economist’s criticism of India’s response, many netizens reacted by reminding him that India’s screening at airports is by far the best compared to most other Western airports such as JFK in New York or, Heathrow in London. India was among the first country to stop all tourist visas to put a stop to foreigners bringing in the virus. The arrivals of cruise ships have also been curbed. A noted healthcare expert tweeted that, “…Before the outbreak, all measures will seem draconian; after the outbreak is over, any measure will look inadequate.” Hence, by invoking Epidemics Act and Disaster Management Act, the government has rightly acted towards isolating the virus. These invocations, not only provides additional funds for the state governments to fight the Covid-19, but also allows them to ban all social gatherings to stop the community transmission of the virus. Moreover, by placing masks and sanitizers under essential commodities, the government has ensured the requisite availability of these crucial frontline supplies. The network of labs equipped to test COVID-19 has also been expanded to 52. Our Prime Minister himself is directly monitoring the efforts on containing Covid-19. An emergency control room in New Delhi is tracking all the Coronavirus cases and keeping a tab on new developments. On the Information, Education and Communication (IEC) front, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is doing a good job in busting fake news and ensuring citizens are adequately informed to fight Covid-19 on an individual level. The Ministry has even launched comics to adequately inform the children! By now, we all know the famous Coronavirus warning dialler tone. Nevertheless, government needs to maintain caution for the next couple of months while ensuring citizens, individually, don’t bring the guard down too. This is because while the Covid-19 may disappear with the rising summer, the chances are that it may hit back with greater vengence post November as winter sets in. The population at airports needs care, coordination and communication, but we must remember that Indias still largely travel by trains and buses, especially private buses. The Health Ministry and the State Governments need to instruct private bus operators to sanitize their buses. Indians travelling by trains also need to be instructed to maintain hygiene and trains need to be equipped with sanitizers. Indian Railways could provide subsidized hand sanitizers to all the travellers as they provide water bottles. There is no doubt the Government of India is making commendable progress in containing the outbreak. But we must not let the guard down until there is sufficient evidence of the absence of the virus completely from the country. Two thousand years ago, Kautilya in his Arthashastra laid emphasis on how a king has to put focus on public health. He exhorts for cleanliness in society to contain spread of communicable diseases (We must thank the Prime Minister for his Swatch Bharat initiative, which definitely will be an important bulwark in fighting Coronavirus). He especially lays focus on how physicians had to send reports urgently about any disease outbreaks. For our modern day rulers, Kautilya urges to ensure that communication lines are absolutely transparent and running between the top and bottom of administrative hierarchy.

Pakistan's Hidden Shame, 05-Apr-2020,,"Baloch groups are knocking the doors of the UN for long recently they set up a pavilion outside the UN Office at Geneva adjacent to iconic broken chair named as Save the Baloch. But still, their voices are not being heard. The global community has to understand that the Baloch struggle for independence differs significantly from other conflicts in the greater west-Asia, which are defined by religious intolerance and sectarian divisions Baloch people protesting for their human rights in front of UN headquarters Geneva Balochistan is Pakistan's largest province in terms of the area though it has a population of just over 12 million. If we put this in numbers, Balochistan is approximately 44% of the country's total landmass and home to less than 6% of the country's population. It's very thinly populated, and the terrain is mostly barren and consists of deserts and mountains. But Balochistan is not a wasteland it's a goldmine for Pakistan with its vast mineral and natural resources. The province contains plentiful supplies of oil, coal, gas, gold, silver, uranium, and copper. It provides Islamabad direct access to the strategically significant Indian Ocean, with a thousand kilometres of coastline near the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz from where most essential shipping lanes pass through. Despite having such a vast natural wealth, much of the population of the province lives below the poverty line. Balochistan is limited with or no access to education, jobs, electricity, roads and clean water. Barely 41% of the population is literate (the national average is 59%), the unemployment rate is around 30%, and just 7% have access to running water. And while Balochistan provides one-third of Pakistan's natural gas supply only a handful of towns are hooked up to the supply grid. For example, gas reserves were discovered in Sui which lies in the district of Dera Bughti in 1952, but the locals are still using wood as fuel. Other social indicators, such as infant mortality rate and life expectancy, are also low compared to the national average. Let's talk about Balochistan's history and how it merged with Pakistan.  Following the end of British rule and the partition of India in 1947. The Khanate of Kalat, most prominent princely state that existed from 1666-1955 in the centre of modern-day Pakistani Balochistan, was promised autonomy and briefly gained independence from August 1947 to March 1948. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founding father and the country's first Governor-General, proposed a merger of Kalat with the newly created Islamic Republic of Pakistan. But both houses of the Baloch parliament outrightly rejected the incorporation. Then Pakistan decided to use military means to occupy this rebellious territory. So, less than a year later, Jinnah ordered the invasion of Balochistan and annexed it. The Pakistani state deposed the traditional tribal leadership, and the historic Khanate of Kalat ceased to exist in the year 1955. Since then Islamabad has fought the number of insurgencies in the province. Pakistani deep state has always labelled these insurgencies as the handiwork of foreign intelligence agencies. But the truth is that forceful occupation and looting of vast natural resources has fuelled the call of Baloch nationalism as an ordinary Baloch fails to understand why he is forced to live in abject poverty while other provinces of Pakistan are benefitting from the natural resources of his homeland. Now Baloch nationalism has taken a full-fledged shape of a freedom struggle.  Moreover, targeted killings of Baloch leaders and tribal chiefs have acted as a stimulant for separatists' movement. Especially in August 2006 killing of 79-year-old Baloch veteran leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti who was widely respected in Balochistan across all the tribe. Pakistan military establishment is trying to deal with it through a hefty hand. Hence authorities have launched a new campaign of forced disappearance a decade ago in which anyone who is even remotely connected to Baloch nationalist movement is targeted. This has resulted in the removal of a large number of separatist activists, students, suspected militants, protest leaders, and intellectuals. Amnesty International has described this campaign as a ""Kill and Dump"" policy. Pakistan's notorious intelligence agency ISI, military intelligence, and the Frontier Corps (a federal paramilitary force) are running this campaign. They use the ""Kill and Dump"" policy as an instrument of state terror to break the morale of Balochis. According to Voice of Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), an association was representing family members of missing Baloch people. Over 20,000 Baloch have disappeared in the last decade.  Even women, children and the elderly are not spared. The Baloch activists are targeted overseas as well the best example is of Rashid Baloch. Pakistan requested his deportation to UAE. Pakistan claimed he is wanted in connection with charges of terrorism. UAE in June 2019 handed over Rashid Baloch to Pakistan. But since then there are no whereabouts of Rashid no one in Pakistani establishment can explain that what happened to Rashid Baloch. Even his family don't know that whether Rashid was produced in the court of law, rotting in a torture cell or has been killed and dumped. But despite this terror campaign of mighty Pakistan army. This struggle seems to have spread deeper into Baloch society than ever before. Anti-Pakistani sentiments have gripped the entire province. Baloch schoolchildren refuse to sing the national anthem or fly its flag, women, traditionally confined to home, have joined the struggle. Universities have become hotbeds of nationalist sentiment. International community and institutions like the United Nations can't be mute spectators of this brutality in which the state is targeting the whole race.  The Baloch are certainly not religious extremists. They are some of the most secular people in the region. At the heart of their struggle is the demand for national self-determination, not the desire to impose a rule of one religious sect. Hence it becomes a moral duty of the civilised world to lend their support to Baloch people.

Kafirophobia is on the rise in West Asia: ISI-backed Pan-Islamist- Salafi fanatics launch massive witch-hunt against Indians in Islamic countries, 21-Apr-2020,Our Foreign Correspondent,"Cadres of Kerala-based Islamic terrorist outfits pilot hate-campaign against India in West Asia and stoke Hinduphobia among Arabs in response to criticism against the role of Tablighi Jamaat in spreading COVID-19 across India As a result of a relentless anti-India campaign launched by Indian Islamists in response to the Citizenship Amendment Act and Corona Jihad, the Islamist-Salafi fanatics in various West Asian countries have jumped on the bandwagon, and started targetting Hindus working abroad and spitting venom against the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling BJP. Spreading hatred against India in West Asia, Kerala-based Islamic terrorist outfits started this massive witch-hunt against fellow Indians on foreign soil that has now snowballed into a massive anti-India campaign in Arab countries. Kerala-based Islamic extremists pioneered the hate campaign and spread fake videos and hate messages on social media, urging Arabs and local administrations to take punitive actions against Hindus working in West Asia because they “kill Muslims in India with our money”! A Facebook page and twitter profile named ‘NRIs against Hate’ were formed to unleash a flood of fake contents for Islamic groups in Arab countries in order to propagate that India has turned out to be Islamophobic. According to sources, various Islamic organisations based in Kerala used leading businessmen and religious leaders to influence the Arab ruling class and administration and feed them with the fake narrative against India. Various Arab media platforms like Al-Jazeera, Gulf News, Khaleej Times etc. were also used to disseminate the fake news. Even though the Indian media have time and again busted the fake narratives of Al-Jazeera that were aimed at tarnishing India's image at the international level, the Islamist channel refused to air the correct version of the incidents. The on-going hate campaign against India is seen as a part of the ISI operations in Kerala and West Asia. A report passed by Pakistani Senate titled “Policy Guidelines in view of the Latest Situation Developing between India and Pakistan,” suggests its agencies to work on the internal fault lines inside India: “Comprehensive outreach to those segments of Indian public opinion which are opposed to Modi’s extremism and his anti-Pakistan policies including political parties, media, civil society organisations and human rights groups.” Speaking to  Jihadi migrants from Kerala are hell-bent on targeting nationalist Indian citizens who work in West Asia for supporting the policies of the Government of India. Muslim communal elements, especially the members of the Muslim League, Jamaat-e-Islami and Popular Front of India, formed dedicated social media cells in West Asia to identify Hindu social media profiles which supported the Citizenship Amendment Act and criticised the Tablighi Jamaat for spreading COVID-19. In December 2019, an Indian doctor was expelled from service in Qatar after a group of Muslim extremists made the hospital authorities into believing that his Facebook post in support of CAA was against Indian Muslims and communal.  “If the Ministry of External Affairs and Indian Embassies initiated stringent action against those who hold Indian passports and spread fake messages and run anti-India campaign on the foreign soil, the issue would not have escalated. They remained silent when each Indian was dismissed from job and deported to India on fake complaints registered by anti-Hindu groups,” he said on the condition of anonymity. The snow-balling persecution... According to sources, ISI has hired a group of lawyers in various West Asian countries to push their anti-India narratives on Arab soil. Abdur Rahman Nassar, a verified account of an Islamist from Kuwait has been spreading anti-India messages on twitter, propagating fake news and baseless allegations against Indians. He has also shared several doctored images and videos on twitter, to establish his claims that Muslims are mistreated in India! “In 53 Muslim countries Indians where most of them Hindu, are treated with humanity and respect .. How do Muslims are treated in India?,” asks the semi-literate Islamist. Labelling RSS a terrorist organisation, he has shared several fake images intending to vilify India’s nationalist organisation. In a tweet pinned to his profile, Abdur Rahman Nassar has urged the Islamic radicals in the country to send him the details of Indians who write against the minorities in India so that he can initiate legal action against them! “Indian extremists will be watched in the Gulf. If you see extremist writings against minorities in India .. send it private to this account (send the photo + account link) (sic),” he says in the tweet. Hend Qassimi, a verified Twitter user who calls herself ‘Princess’, had warned that ‘Anyone that is openly racist and discriminatory in the UAE will be fined and made to leave.’ She had posted a tweet of an Indian and quoted it as ‘an example’! In the wake of the hate campaign, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi had posted a tweet and said that COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking. ""COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or borders before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together,"" the Prime Minister said. However, instead of warning the Indian Passport holders who are indulged in the hate campaign against India and Hindus in UAE, the Indian Ambassador in UAE chose to remind Indians about the country's moral fabric and rule of law. “Discrimination is against our moral fabric and the Rule of law. Indian nationals in the UAE should always remember this,” his apologetic statement read. Meanwhile, voices are rising from various corners of West Asia that the Arab countries are denying treatment to the migrant workers who tested with Covid 19. According to the sources in West Asia, almost all Arab countries have adopted an Arab-first policy as far as the treatment for Covid-19 is concerned. In almost all West Asian countries, the migrants who have Covid 19 symptoms are not allowed to take the medical test or treatment. This discriminative approach has invoked criticism from various quarters including the Muslim organisations working among migrant workers from various countries.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/4/21/Kafirophobia-is-on-the-rise-in-West-Asia.html
India’s global stature has gone up; Modi has shown the world in successfully fighting coronavirus, 24-Apr-2020,,"Thanks to the legendary administrative understanding of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his visionary leadership, at their best display during the current coronavirus pandemic crisis, India’s global stature has gone up. The deadly coronavirus pandemic, which was first spotted in Wuhan city of China in November, has so far killed more than 191,000 people globally and infected another 2.7 million, has emerged as the deadliest public health challenge in more than a century. In the past few months, economies of countries, which have the world’s best health care facilities, have per capita income much more than India, are falling apart like a pack of cards. The number of people to have died due to coronavirus in these countries is shocking, to say the least, and not been seen since the Spanish flu of 1918-1920. The United States, which is the global leader in health care facilities, medical research and availability of resources, has emerged as the global hotspot of COVID-19. The number of Americans to have died because of coronavirus is fast approaching 50,000; an unbelievable figure for us till a few months ago. More than 8.5 lakh people have been tested positive with coronavirus.And notably, New York, which is the global financial capital and is the best in America’s health care facilities is its epicentre. More than 17,000 people have lost their lives, and 2.5 lakhs have been tested positive. Let’s look at numbers of some of the other top five countries hit by a coronavirus. In the first week of February, India started the evacuation of its citizens from other countries. On February 3, Prime Minister constituted and chaired a meeting of the empowered group of Ministers on COVID-19, which issued the travel advisory against China. States were taken into confidence, and a strong monitoring mechanism was established In Italy, more than 25,000 people have died and 187,000 infected; in Spain, over 21,000 have died, and more than two lakhs infected; and France over 21,000 have died, and 119,000 have been infected. In the United Kingdom, where it's Prime Minister Borris Johnson had to be taken to ICU, more than 18,000 have died, and 1.3 lakhs have been infected. Well, it’s for these countries to ponder upon their fight against coronavirus, and review post-COVID 19 as to what went wrong and how this shocking loss of lives could have been prevented. No doubt, we are in the middle of this pandemic, and we still have a long way to go, before this could be brought under control, India by any standard, so far, has performed much better than others. A country of 130 billion people living in one of the highest densely populated areas of the world, with a poor basic health care infrastructure and facilities including a low number of per capita availability of beds and doctors, the thus far low infection rate (a little over 20,000 by April 23) and 652 deaths, is nothing but remarkable. Sitting thousands of miles away in New York, under stay-at-home order for the past several weeks, I feel proud of my country and the leadership that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his “Team India” has shown in this fight against invisible coronavirus. One of the key reasons for this, I believe is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team acted early and decisively. The blue bar line for PM Modi has surged above any  Team India, under Prime Minister Modi, has been acting at lightning speed. It was on January 7 that China identified coronavirus as the causative agent. A day later, on January 8, the Union Ministry of Health held its first joint monitoring mission meeting, and within ten days on January 17, India started screening of all passengers coming from China. By the end of the month, the government had identified and activated to test for coronavirus and established quarantine centres. Remember, at this point, the rest of the world was very unfamiliar with the dangers that COVID 19 poses to humanity. In the first week of February, India started the evacuation of its citizens from other countries. On February 3, Prime Minister constituted and chaired a meeting of the empowered group of Ministers on COVID-19, which issued the travel advisory against China. States were taken into confidence, and a strong monitoring mechanism was established. The list goes on.India’s relatively low figure is attributable to the fundamental principle that the Prime Minister acted on: prevention is better than cure. Being part of New York, where I have been witness to deaths of more than 17,000 people, I wish the authorities here would have thought on those lines. I wish, both the State Government and the City Mayor would have enforced a strong locked-down, as India has enforced nationwide. If India a country of 130 million people can do it, why cannot New York? The difference here is leadership and preventive action.  In the crucial first few weeks in New York, the leaders here were busy in the war of words because of their political differences. In India, Prime Minister Modi brought the entire country together. For the first time probably in decades, or normally seen under war-like situations, Chief Ministers from opposition parties joined his call of action. He successfully formed “Team India.” As the first phase of three-week nationwide lockdown was about to end, it was the opposition ruled State Government which started talking about its extension. I wish the authorities here would have thought on those lines India walked. I wish, both the State Government and the City Mayor would have enforced a strong locked-down, as India has enforced nationwide. If India a country of 130 million people can do it, why cannot New York? The difference here is leadership and preventive action And at the regional and global level too, Prime Minister Modi took the initiative and leadership role in this fight against humanity. He convened a video conference of SAARC leaders and took the initiative of setting up a regional fund with an initial contribution of USD 10 million to help South Asian countries. He encouraged the same within the G-20 group. Soon Saudi Arabia, which holds the current presidency of the group, organised the video conferencing. And as word spread that hydroxychloroquine is effective in the treatment in early COVID-19 patients, India under Modi started flying planeloads of this malaria drug to countries across the world. So far more than 80 countries, including the United States, have received this key India made drug. India is at the forefront of this wart against humanity.

Mahatma Gandhi NREGA meets critical development needs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, 14-Aug-2020,,"Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), extended to the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir (J & K), now the two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, through an amendment in the Act in 2007, meets critical development needs of the people, living in the shadow of militancy, and neglected rural development for years. It has initiated much needed local level participatory development, especially after the elections of Halqa Panchayat (Gram Panchayat) in November 2018. Many critical rural infrastructural development works, like irrigation canal, the life line of agriculture and horticulture, especially in the Kashmir valley, which were in dilapidated conditions, have been revived and renovated through MGNREGA that has also built other useful rural infrastructures, like connectivity, water harvesting bodies, play grounds for youths. MGNREGA provides annually about Rs. 1000 crore to Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh that is utilized by 4483 elected Halqa Panchayats (Gram panchayat) of the two UTs. By an amendment in the Panchayat Raj Act of J&K in October 2018, all the 29 items (merged into 21 items) as per the provision of the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act were brought under the purview of PRIs. Since 1 June 2020, 100 per cent of the MGNREGA fund is utilized by Halqa panchayat. J&K has also decentralised payment procedure under MGNREGA and authorised Sarpanch and Panchayat Secretary as signatories of fund transfer order (FTO). Both the UTs have already utilized about 1450.45 crore in 2019-20 and 2020-21 (upto July). It has provided 3.5 crore persondays of employment in Jammu and Kashmir and 24 lakhs persondays in Ladakh, benefitting more than one fourth of the total rural households of the two UTs and about nine lakh workers. Over the last two years, MGNREGA has become more focussed towards creation of productive community and individual assets, mainly related to agriculture and allied activities, although works related to rural connectivity are still taken up in large number, as there is a high demand for RCC road, footpath and pavement. A total of 1 lakh 81 thousand works in J&K and 4 thousand in Ladakh have been completed during FY 2019-20  to FY 2020-21 (upto July). Community ponds, storm drain, RCC road, culvert, construction and renovation of kulh/canal have been undertaken in large numbers in both the UTs. In Jammu and Kashmir alone, around 35 thousand water conservation and water harvesting works, 41 thousand micro irrigation works, 87 thousand flood control and flood protection works and 41 thousand land development works have been completed in 2019-20 and in 2020-21 upto July. In Ladakh, around 500 water conservation and water harvesting works, 5 thousand micro irrigation works, 700 Flood Control and flood protection works and 3 thousand land development works have been completed during the same period. Agriculture and horticulture are the life line of rural population, especially in the Kashmir valley. However, for years, there was little investment in irrigation. Many of the traditional water bodies, especially Kulh, a kind of irrigation channel, had become dead. After the election of the Panchayat, PRI representatives started responding to the local demand and utilized MGNREGA funds in a big way to fulfil them. Renovation of kulh is one of them. In Kanjikulah village of Behibagh of Kulgam District, most of the households are dependent on horticulture, mainly apple, pear, orange. The kulh, which used to provide water to the apple orchards, had got silted and encroached upon. Apple orchard in about 400 kanals of land was on the verge of being wilted. Productivity of apple had already declined. The Gram Sabha of the newly elected Panchayat passed a resolution for the renovation of the kulh through MGNREGA. The work was taken up in two phases in 2018-19 and 2019-20. More than 100 households comprising of 4 surrounding hamlets, viz. Kanjikular, Kokargund, Katpora and Brihard have benefitted from the revival of this Kulh. It provides irrigation to about 50 acres of horticulture land, mainly apple orchard, apart from some paddy field. In Gool Block of Ramban District, a large number of Bowlies (a traditional water body for providing drinking water to villagers and their cattle), there are separate Bowlies for human being and animals, were revived and renovated. A total of 61 such water bodies have been developed in nine Panchayats of the Block in the last one year. The Government of J & K has taken another initiativesto reach to the rural people through an innovative ‘Back to Village’ programme under which a very senior official, often secretary level, makes a comprehensive review of development works and development requirement of the people by reaching them directly. S/he also spends a night in the village. It gives unique opportunity to the villagers to bring to the attention of the government their difficulties and development needs. The week-long programme has been successfully run twice in July and November 2018. The programme along with panchayat elections have proved much helpful in invigorating community participation in rural development. In J& K and Ladakh, MGNREGA has been further strengthened in the current financial year. Cluster Facilitation Project (CFP), an initiative of the Government of India to ensure effective implementation of MGNREGA in aspirational Districts and other backward areas, by providing assistance for planning, coordination and monitoring through dedicated teams of thematic experts, has been implemented in two Blocks each in Kupwara and Baramullah District of J & K. Both the UTs have joined the Unnati (progress) scheme that provides skill training to MGNREGA workers, for their uplift from a casual to a skilled worker. J&K has identified 1200 workers for skill training under Unnati Scheme for the FY 2020-21. CFP and Unnati schemes are 100% funded by the Government of India. Both the UTs have also joined the National Electronic Fund Management System (NEFMS) that would enable release of MGNREGA wage payment directly to the account of workers. MGNREGA is a real asset and a very potent tool for participatory development at the grassroots level.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/14/Mahatma-Gandhi-NREGA-meets-critical-development-needs-of-Jammu-Kashmir-and-Ladakh.html

Why Self-reliance and Swadeshi are Critical in the Post COVID-19 Era, 26-Aug-2020, - Dilip Rath,"As it combats the coronavirus, India needs to support MSMEs and boost domestic production for ensuring supply chains are not unduly disrupted. The COVID-19  pandemic has heavily disrupted global supply chains largely dependent on the Dragon Kingdom. Be it telecom supplies, Rare Earth minerals, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and other key elements, disruptions in supplies have led to shortages of key items. In turn, varied sectors have had to suspend operations while prices soared due to these disruptions. It is against this backdrop that Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s recent announcement about being “vocal for local” needs to be viewed. The PM’s emphasis on self-reliance is already a part of our national ethos. Let’s not forget, it was the Swadeshi Movement that rocked the British in the early 20th Century. Similarly, as the world reels from the devastating repercussions of the COVID-19 outbreak, this is the right moment when India can promote ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ and ‘Make in India’ mission by incentivising Indian companies as well as foreign companies seeking to relocate their operations from other countries. Self-reliance and MSMEs Moreover, there cannot be a better moment than the present when the country has unveiled a slew of economic and policy reforms. The Centre has opened up all the sectors hitherto reserved for the public sector in non-strategic domains, permitting private companies to invest in these industries.[ As the focus shifts to self-reliance as well as domestic production and manufacturing, the Centre is cognizant of the fact that Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are India’s largest job creators. A survey by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) reveals that in the last four years, MSMEs were the nation’s largest job creators. Backed by 13.9% growth during this period, MSMEs will continue being the top job creators for the next three years too.[ Going by official statistics,  Against this backdrop, the Centre has announced a series of steps to help MSMEs withstand the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian economy. Accordingly, MSMEs are eligible for collateral-free automatic loans with a four-year loan tenure.[  Furthering the sharpening of its focus on domestic production, the Centre has paid heed to the MSMEs citing unfair competition from foreign entities in government procurement tenders based on the size and strength advantage of these companies. Therefore, global tenders in such schemes up to Rs200 crore will no longer be allowed. This apart, other incentives to MSMEs – such as doing away with audits for small entities with an annual turnover of Rs5 crore – would also be helpful. Promoting Cooperation Yet, more often in the past, the discourse in the public domain focussed on supporting big companies or MNCs while MSMEs remained largely forgotten or were mentioned in passing. This paradigm needs to change if the country seeks to promote greater jobs creation and follow the PM’s “vocal for local” call. This brings us back to the Swadeshi rationale. Quite often we hear about talk on regional asmita (pride, self-respect) in certain circumstances. Apart from simply regional, we should also focus on Bharatiya asmita. It is through the spirit of cooperative federalism that the nation can take faster strides and reach greater heights of prosperity, benefitting all states and Union Territories, big or small. Remember, it was the concept of dairy cooperatives that made India self-sufficient in milk. Later, this cooperative success led to growth of private sector in the dairy industry, which is doing equally well as they continue adhering to the Indian ethos of cooperation while keeping the societal good in mind. Finally, it is important to note that, after agriculture, MSMEs are the top job creators, employing 120 million people in various verticals.[  India needs to follow its own and unique model of development, which can be tweaked across states to reflect local aspirations and ground realities. As the world has been witnessing over the past few decades, the western economic model based on unbridled spending and over exploitation of natural resources can have disastrous environmental impact and can create serious social, economic and financial fault lines and volatility that could trigger economic disruptions. When an unexpected pandemic strikes, it only exacerbates any ongoing crises. The ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan ’  announced by the Honourable Prime Minister would go a long way in rejuvenating our rural sector.  The National Dairy Development Board has already demonstrated sustainable business models in promoting scientific dairying and adoption of integrated approach to farming, centred around dairying, to include poultry, horticulture, fisheries, manure management, bee keeping and organic farming practices, which would enhance incomes of farmers and create rural wealth.  Gandhiji’s dream of Gram Swaraj re-articulated by the Honourable Prime Minister in his vision for Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan and Adarsh Gram Yojana has the power to transform rural economy and serve as the foundation for building a truly self-reliant India.  It is time for all stakeholders to work in coordination to achieve the much cherished goal of “vocal for local”.

"Vacate all illegally occupied areas of India, India Strongly Opposed Pakistan Supreme Court's order on Gilgit-Baltistan", 04-May-2020,,"S. Jaishankar, Minister of External Affairs of India On Monday, Ministry of External affairs India has strongly protested against Pakistan's efforts to bring material change in Pakistan occupied territories of Jammu and Kashmir & Ladakh and asked Pakistan (neighbouring country ) to vacate them. In a press statement issued by the Ministry, External Affairs said that India demarche senior Pakistan diplomat and lodged a strong protest against Supreme Court of Pakistan order on the so-called ""Gilgit-Baltistan”. It was conveyed to Pakistani Government that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of India under its fully legal and irrevocable accession. So, Pakistan and it's Judiciary as well as Government of Pakistan has no locus stand on territories which were forcibly and illegally occupied by the direct attack of Pakistan in association with trained hired agents( so-called as Kabayalies) Since 1947, on the boundaries of the then erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir. India said on Monday and strongly objected the former's efforts to bring ""material change"" in areas under its occupation and asked Pakistan to must vacate all areas under its illegal trade from last seven decades. The government of India actively opposing such actions by the neighbouring country, i.e. Pakistan and continued attempts to bring material changes in Pakistan occupied areas of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. India never gave up its claim on the region, though Pakistan has the illegal control over PoJK. In Parliament of India, India had passed a resolution on February 22, 1994 : 1. The state of Jammu and Kashmir has been being and shall be an integral part of India, and any attempts to separate it from the rest of the country will be resisted by all necessary means 2. India has will and capacity to firmly counter all designs against its unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity and demands. 3. Pakistan must vacate the areas of the India state of Jammu and Kashmir, which they have occupied through aggression and resolves that. 4.All attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met resolutely The Resolution was unanimously adopted. So it is all clear that Pakistan and its Government has no locus stand in Jammu and Kashmir and its illegal forcible occupation over the area of Indian territories from the past seven decades is a gross violation of the international law. It was further conveyed that no such actions of Pakistan and it's Judiciary can neither hide the illegal, forcibly occupation on the areas of Indian Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh by Pakistan nor the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom to the people residing in Pakistan occupied territories for the past seven decades.

Clinical Display of Infused Diplomacy, 22-May-2020,,"Being world’s largest democracy is not merely a thing of pride. There is an added responsibility too. Juxtapose these mere facts of life with the COVID-19 crisis, the government of the day has an onerous task at hand to help hundreds of Indians who are overseas and stranded. Come to this test and the Modi Government has done pretty well. As key stakeholders, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla engage themselves with their counterparts across the globe – a new phraseology has emerged in the boardroom – a new “template of globalisation” and call for neo international institutions to reflect contemporary realities. This neo-globalisation also would mean ensuring safe return home of the ‘stranded Indians’ during the time of crisis. “With the launch of the Vande Bharat Mission from May 7, the massive Government effort to respond to the Covid-19 situation entered a new phase. The Vande Bharat Mission is the largest and most complex exercise ever undertaken by the government for the repatriation of our nationals stranded overseas,” says Anurag Srivastava, a spokesman in the Ministry of External Affairs.   “We are working very closely with the Ministries of Civil Aviation, Home Affairs, Health & Family Welfare as well as concerned state governments in this exercise,” he explains. Between May 7 and 14, in fact, as many as 12,000 Indian nationals have safely returned home. “Fifty six flights have brought back our nationals from 12 countries. Also, 904 Indians were repatriated from Maldives by INS Jalashwa and INS Magar on May 10 and May 12 respectively. Some others have arrived through deportation flights from various countries,” adds Srivastava.  Meanwhile, the government sources have indicated that the second phase of Vande Bharat Mission – to bring back home more Indians - will be launched between May 16 and 22. And the operation will help bring back stranded Indians from 31 countries.  About 150 flights including feeder flights would be deployed for the same. It goes without stating that the evacuation exercise started in March itself. Some of the works required going beyond the call of duty and thus specific interventions were required as in the case of the Diamond Princess crew in Japan or the rescue of pilgrims in Iran.  Much to the credit of the efforts on March 15, 2020, Dr Jaishankar could announce that 234 Indians stranded in Iran returned home. The batch comprised 131 students and 103 pilgrims. Earlier another batch of 44 Indian pilgrims also arrived India from Iran. In the second phase, in addition to the first list of countries, MEA spokesman said additional 18 countries to be covered under the second phase, i.e. Indonesia, Thailand, Australia, Italy, France, Germany, Ireland, Canada, Japan, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Georgia, Tajikistan and Armenia.  “As you can see, we are broadening the ambit every week in a phased manner, keeping with our quarantine capacity, health protocols, etc. Till now 1,88,646 Indian nationals have registered to return on the portal,” he noted on May 14. In addition, a total number of 27 flights were ear-marked to take off from the Gulf region during Week 1 - UAE-11, Saudi Arabia-5, Kuwait-5, Bahrain-2, Qatar-2 and Oman-2. The government also operated seven flights during the first Week from Bangladesh carrying passengers bound for Srinagar, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. Stranded Indians from abroad would be brought from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Russia, Germany, Spain and Thailand. On May 7, 2020 - Air India flight IX-452 from Abu Dhabi to Kochi with 181 passengers and Air India flight IX-344 from Dubai to Kozhikode with 182 passengers. Braving Politics However, there would be issues and complaints in one form or the other. As expected, there were ‘political challenges’ too as West Bengal Minister Partha Chatterjee, a known close aide of mercurial Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, on May 14 made a very unrealistic but critical tweet. “Is the MEA asking us to believe that there are enough people to come from Georgia to Gujarat but none want to come to Kolkata? Also, there are enough people to come back to Bihar from Kyrgyzstan but not enough to bring back to Bengal?,” wrote Chatterjee. MEA spokesman Srivastava quickly countered this saying – “MEA does not discriminate between states. GOI’s Vande Bharat Mission is for all stranded Indians, including those from West Bengal. Over 3700 of them have registered for repatriation from different parts of the world”.  In another missive, the MEA spokesman responded: “Will gladly facilitate flights to Kolkata if the State Government confirms arrangements to receive and quarantine. MEA will also help in return of WB residents through land borders with neighbours. We hope to receive an early response on the matter.” Modi Injects Life to Global Diplomacy Notwithstanding the row triggered by West Bengal’s ruling party, it goes without stating that in general, the coordination between states and the MEA on the massive evacuation exercise in adherence to the COVID crisis protocols have been very smooth. It is not without good reason that on the day the flight landed in Bhubaneswar, External Affairs Minister Dr Jaishankar was himself on the microblogging site recording his appreciation for the Biju Janata Dal regime in Odisha. “Pleased to welcome the 1st flight into Odisha. AI Flt 1996 has just landed in Bhubaneswar (on May 14) bringing back 151 Indians from Dubai. Thanks to @airindiain, @MoCA_GoI & Odisha Govt for support and cooperation,” Dr Jaishankar wrote. In this context, examining the smart diplomacy pursued by India and its Prime Minister Modi would be relevant.   There is little to dispute that globally all key power-players were found in confrontation with each other. Most major powers thought the Coronaries could be tackled locally. It was more so in US-China ties and within Europe. But the Indian leadership threw in a surprise and sought to give relevance to something called SAARC, which had almost lost its relevance. So much indifference has been Modi’s approach towards SAARC that for May 2019 swearing-in ceremony, he invited BIMSTEC leaders unlike 2014. Moreover, Modi kept on talking to international leaders – big and small – and gave a crystal clear message that the unseen virus was a global pandemic and ought to be tackled in an integrated manner. For example, Modi’s interaction with Mette Frederiksen, Prime Minister of Denmark.  “The leaders compared notes on the steps taken in the two countries to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. Prime Minister appreciated Denmark’s success in lifting the lockdown restrictions without causing an increase in infections. It was agreed that Indian and Danish experts would remain in touch to learn from each other’s experience,” said the official note. In another instance, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla got engaged with his counterparts from the United States, Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, and Vietnam in weekly telephonic conversations. This practice of weekly tele conversations was initiated by US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun. “These discussions among the partner countries have helped shape informed and coordinated responses to the evacuation of stranded nationals from each other’s territories; maintenance of critical supplies of life-saving medicines and protective health equipment; extension and facilitation of visas for each other’s nationals caught in circumstances beyond their control,” an MEA statement said. These conversations have brought out the need for real-time communication among partner countries on the evolving challenges and learning from each other’s best practices based on the reality that no one can be safe and secure unless all are safe and secure, it said. On May 6 again, PM Modi also spoke to none other than Abiy Ahmed Ali, Prime Minister of a tiny yet important country like Ethiopia. The Prime Minister also discussed Corona crisis with the President of Uganda. The ‘Non Aligned Movement’ was another platform which was infused with a fresh lease of life with the 21st-century spirit and clamour for new world order. The Cold War-era relic suddenly shot into the limelight and emerged as a podium to project ‘New’ India’s humanitarian response and global outreach.  PM Modi has underlined in more ways than one that the test of the leadership would remain in how regional and global players come together to work in unity of purpose. The quality of global governance will be truly measured by how the casualty figure is kept at a minimum and fast the world can contain the pandemic. Mission Sagar Taking this spirit along Prime Minister also said, “The world is beginning to believe that India can do very well, so much good for the welfare of mankind”. This optimism has been rightly summed up by External Affairs Minister Dr Jaishankar. “India is today driven by a new vision, a stronger purpose and a deeper commitment. A self-reliant India has more to offer to the world,” he tweeted. ",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/22/Clinical-Display-of-Infused-Diplomacy.html
Untold story of Invasion and Destruction of Tibet by Communist China, 29-May-2020,,"No country has stood up and actively opposed the grave and open human rights violations in Tibet by Communist China. Law of jungle still prevails here as the bigger fish goes on eating the smaller fish, with no protest from the world. - Meera Sharma Tibet’s occupation by China has been the most violent episodes of 20th century forgotten by the world The Physical Invasion It includes deadly plots, which it shouldn't have. It includes conspiracies, economic ambitions, which it shouldn't include. It includes murders in masses, which should have been out of the question! Because it is Tibet we're talking about, it is Buddhism we're referring to, and it is the world's forbidden city we're calling out to. All this started getting buried in the past, centuries ago, but the suffering took an even more dreadful shape in the 19th century by the great empire of 'The Republic Of China'. It seemed the law of jungle still prevailed. The bigger fish goes on eating, the smaller fish – no protest. Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong etc., the list of the countries is long but well in the clutches of the Republic. To understand what causes the Chinese to be so anxious and ambitious to gain lands and grow, can only be understood through their mindsets which are ruled by many historical state of affairs that came their way moulding them into who they are today. It also becomes essential to understand this for the futures to come and to understand what to expect. According to the New York Times report, the three points that the Chinese leaders give their people, which makes them strive for more than others, and to see the world through a narrow mindset are, first, 100 years of humiliation by the western imperialists, second, ten years of unrest under the Cultural Revolution, third, 25 years of an economic miracle under reforms and openness introduced by Denzin Xiaoping. The first two creates isolation from the west and the world, whereas the third glorifies the self-made efforts for reforms rather than trusting the country with anyone else. 'Fear of chaos has developed conservatism and the nation's shrewd ambitions.'  As researched by The College of Staten Island's Modern China Studies Group, Chinese people are consumed by anxiety about more mundane issues. As one popular saying in China goes, ""the reform on the state-owned enterprises is to keep you off work, the housing reform is to empty your pocket, the educational reform is to drive your parents crazy, and the medical health reform is to send you to the grave ahead of time."" This showcases how the Chinese community looks at the world beyond their borders. Tibet was invaded, pillaged, raped, and destroyed. It had no armies, no weapons, no tanks, but their monasteries were robbed, priceless historical and religious scriptures burned, monks tortured, and nuns raped before being murdered. China’s has used force and violence to suppress the Tibetan freedom movement and diplomatic manoeuvres to silence the world The starting incidents can make you laugh but also strike right on the problem of Chinese materialistic ideology! When in 1953 a group of 10 Chinese soldiers in Khaki arrived in Sakya, Tibet, they were shown disapproval by the local people clapping and cursing which was a common way of dogpa (negation of evil). The soldiers, rather than understanding the insult, joined them in clapping, amazed by the welcome they had just received! It was a thing to wonder for them that insult and disapproval can also be so peaceful and non-violent. The red materialism was far away from such phenomena. Series of diplomatic steps were taken intelligently by the Chinese to gain sympathy and feeling for the Republic. Some of which included gaining the trust of Aristocrats and the upper-class people after the Seventeen point agreement (1951) which gave Tibet the freedom to be autonomous. The aristocrats were promised their power and status would prevail forever even after the reforms take place, and it might as well increase. These people were chosen for special tours to the industrialized regions of China for them to return, impressed by the Red form of governance. The irony is that communism was built with great respect for labourers, daily wage workers, lower class common people but rather the communist state was using factors and people to fulfil its ambitions against which and whom, it had stood up for once: aristocracy. Flaws are inevitable. Slow poisoning of Tibet Tibetan cities were divided into teams of underemployed Chinese officials. Criminals of Tibet who would work with cruelty were employed as heads of these groups as they were offered positions to pay off old scores. Seventeen point agreement in 1951: Tibetans were handed over materialistic freedom by the Chinese giving them political and cultural freedom in an autonomous region. Unaware that Tibetan independence was always based more on their life and culture than the law and history. Surprisingly the economic condition of the peasants and herdsmen of the non-communist state of Tibet was far better than the ROC. Maybe this became one of the reasons why labourers were not focused on for ideological transformations as it seemed practically impossible to show a better system than the one prevalent in Tibet for them. The next set of transformation lot(group) after the aristocrats started hanging Mao's clay statues in their homes secretly, no need to mention how influenced they were, came the young minds when in 1956 blue coloured uniformed personnel came to Tibet to open 'Red Schools', and to start youth organizations while politely asking Tibetans to merge traditional schools with these. Of course, the first to admit were the children of the aristocrats and ruling class of Tibet, going well with Pecking's (Beijing till 1979) strategy of the ruling class being made to play an important role in bringing up a peaceful revolution. Almost all the local rulers unconsciously supported this backstabbing strategy, unaware of what they are yet to see. The aristocrats were paid for their patriotism and cooperation. The labourers were paid to build the military road for the Chinese, and not shockingly children were paid to attend the red school monthly. All these incidents and practices are stark opposite to what the red book stands for. The silver dollars' da Yuan' exchanged pockets in Tibet to build 'silver dollar road' from Beijing to Tibet. The most intelligent among the people from Tibet were undoubtedly the peasants, labourers and the common man who was doubtful from the beginning and dismissed the new idea, though still working for the 'da Yuan'. They did not give in their ideology. Subjugation, Divide and rule The idea of the Chinese was to end Buddhist ideology through the slow poison of leaving them uneducated and firing 'thamzing' (Class struggle). “The Burning Monk,” Thich Quang Duc, burned himself to protest against China’s occupation of Tibet, use of force and violence History does repeat itself. The way labourers and common men fought against the aristocrats to develop a classless society, the warrior tribe of Tibet, Khampas, in turn, fought against the Chinese for their freedom. The shift is clear, and the ideology of the red book appears more flawed than ever. After this began the backstabbing by the Chinese, starting with the aristocrats and high-class people who were the first one to be used. They were thrown to the jails after calling them on the pretext of attending an educational programme. But opposite to that, the leaders were captured on the charge of treason. This disarmed the local people of their leaders for the Chinese to introduce the reforms of 'unification' finally. After this is what began the 'the dark time'. Tibet was invaded, pillaged, raped, and destroyed. It had no armies, no weapons, no tanks, but their monasteries were robbed, priceless historical and religious scriptures burned, monks tortured, and nuns raped before being murdered. Tibetans were forced not to meditate, but to work in the fields. It was a common and painful site for the Tibetans to see llamas carrying wastes and excreta to manure the Chinese fields instead of the beautiful sites of them chanting 'Om Mani Padme hum' or silently meditating. This is an example of one of the greatest violation of human rights and freedom of a human. Soon, the cities were divided into various teams of underemployed Chinese officials, and it should not be shocking at this point, the criminals of Tibet were employed as head of the groups. They were offered such positions to pay off old scores and no doubt, they then worked precisely the way they were told, with cruelty. At this point, the first point of Chinese competitive and anxious nature, with what we started, comes into play. To develop such competitive feelings, they were unable to use the three points of history for Tibetans. Still, they made different teams among the cities to compete with one another declaring and awarding the most patriotic and hardworking labour and humiliating the last. The creation of China's artificial copy has been in process. Vilifying Tibet and its belief system Tibetan Religion was called poison; their gods were referred to as ""mud images"" and the holy monks as bloodsuckers. After all such preaching, Tibetans were told they have freedom for religion! This showcases that Buddhism was slow poisoned, the process of which is still on. As the children got gradually educated, the ideology of atheism was attempted to seep deep down into them. The life since then in the most peaceful lands of the world has narrowed down to only two things: Beijing's re-education policy and hard labour. This continues in the present with the least international support for the Forbidden City. No doubt no country stood up actively opposing this grave and open human rights violation happening because it is a little of Gold, Uranium and other metals plentiful in those previously closed lands. With this I repeat - It seems the law of jungle still prevails, the bigger fish goes on eating, the smaller fish – no protest. This fight with Tibet started ideologically, which witnessed a considerable number of ironies to communism. No other example I believe captures its imperfections best than the sacrifice of one peaceful nation. The baseline remains that materialism doesn't succumb to any ideology and never will it in the future. What always rules and should is one's freedom to choice and independence of lands, and this demands international unity above matter and money as both of them must complement peace and not separate the two.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/29/Untold-story-of-Invasion-and-Destruction-of-Tibet-by-Communist-China.html
Border standoff amid Covid19; China’s worst diplomatic faux pas, 28-May-2020,,"Modi’s (Donald) Trump card is working. Something fruitful and big is in the making between US-India; that has impinged China. China’s border standoff is like escort of Superpower BHARAT. Current border-standoff initiated by China can become China’s Worst diplomatic faux pas. In order to distract the world from COVID19 mishandling,  China initiated impingement syndrome in global diplomacy starting from Hong-Kong – Taiwan suppression, South-sea provocation and now needling India with border standoff. Mr Prasoon Sharma, Honorary Fellow- Global Governance Institute, London said “This will strengthen India’s global stature and position as global anti-china forces will rally behind India. China is feeling weak and frustrated by PM Modi’s diplomatic wins. First, by re-ensuring power of Democracy, PM Modi has set an example of democratic activism in combating the Corona challenge. Prime Minister Modi, together with his federal colleagues, is leading from the front and has successfully implemented lockdown and social distancing measures with full popular support. Second, by helping the world, PM Modi enhanced India’s soft power by supplying medicines (generic and HCQ) to more than 70 countries. Third, by setting the trend, Taking a cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conferencing with the SAARC leaders, Saudi Arabia scheduled an Extraordinary Virtual G20 Leaders’ Summit. Fourth, the rise of Superpower BHARAT, India as WHO Executive Board Chairman will scrutinise all the investigation proposed by various counties against China for mishandling COVID19.” Further, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that Washington is discussing restructuring (moving out of china) global supply chains with India. A Big defence announcement about signing of India-Australia mutual logistics support agreement may happen soon. Fifth, by boosting the swadeshi mission, China’s border confrontation will boost the swadeshi and “Make in India” mission. After the fall in trade with the US, Declining business in India will frustrate Chinese companies like Xiaomi, Vivo. On the contrary, if this border confrontation is Xi’s invitation to Modi to come on the negotiation table, then by maintaining Doklam style stand- stern on action but balanced in diplomatic positioning- India may create major embarrassment and loss for Xi. Because the longer the standoff goes the greater opportunity India gets to consolidate Ant-China countries and organisations. In case, China withdraws or mellow down sooner; then Xi will be seen as a weak leader internally. At last, in recent Russian military ranking, China’s army ranked 157 even below the Somali army.  The reasons why Chinese soldiers ranked low are: fear of death, greed for money, and lack of discipline",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/28/China-s-Worst-diplomatic-faux-pas.html
No recent talks between PM Modi and American President Trump: Sources, 29-May-2020,,"The Indian government clarified no conversation has taken place between PM Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump. Sources in New Delhi said the late conversation between the two took place on April 4, and that was on the issue of hydroxychloroquine New Delhi: “There has been no recent contact between PM Modi and President Trump. The last conversation between them was on April 4, 2020, on the subject of hydroxychloroquine,” Government sources revealed here. Sources also clarified that New Delhi is not interested for any intervention or mediation by President Trump on the on-going border row between India and China. “On May 28, MEA had also made it clear that we are directly in touch with the Chinese through established mechanisms and diplomatic contacts,” sources said. The clarification from the Indian government source comes after President Trump’s remarks triggered a minor row and created a room for speculation about possible Modi-Trump tele talks. “I can tell you; I did speak to Prime Minister Modi. He is not in a good mood about what is going on with China,” Trump told reporters during his customary Oval Office briefing. MEA spokesman Anurag Srivastava on Thursday politely rejected Trump’s offer for any negotiation. “We are engaged with the Chinese side to peacefully resolve the issue”, he has said. Srivastava further said, “Our troops have taken very responsible approach towards border managem ent and strictly follow the procedures laid out in various bilateral agreements and protocols with China to resolve any issue that may arise in the border areas”. “The two sides have established mechanism both at a diplomatic and military level to resolve situations which may arise in border areas peacefully through dialogue,” he said adding Indian forces will strictly follow the “consensus reached by our leaders and the guidance” provided. Amid heightened tension along India-China border, the US President Trump had tweeted on Wednesday saying, “We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute”. India has earlier categorically rejected Trump’s keenness to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir. Srivastava said India is committed to the objective of maintenance of “peace and tranquility” in the border areas with China and our armed forces “scrupulously follow the consensus reached by our leaders and the guidance provided”. “At the same time, we remain firm in our resolve to ensuring India’s sovereignty and national security,” he asserted. It was also pointed out that since 1993, India and China have signed several bilateral agreements and protocols to ensure Peace and Tranquility in the India-China border areas. These include 1993 Agreement on Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border areas; the 1996 Agreement on Confidence Building Measures in the Military Field along the LAC; the 2005 Protocol on Modalities for the implementation of the Confidence Building Measures in the Military Field along the LAC; the 2012 Agreement on the establishment of a working mechanism for consultation and coordination on India-China Border Affairs; and the 2013 Border Defence Cooperation Agreement.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/29/No-recent-talks-between-PM-Modi-and-American-President-Trump-Sources.html

Trump invites Modi to G7 as first ever virtual bilateral summit between India-Australia to be held on June 4, 03-Jun-2020,,"- Nirendra Dev New Delhi: In a major boost to India's global standing in the context of changing dynamics and China getting international heat, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday extended an invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the next G-7 Summit to be held in the United States. At present, the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom are members of G-7and invitation extended to Modi is only a reflection of India's new found position in the fast emerging new world order. ""The exceptional warmth and candour of the conversation reflected the special nature of the Indo-US ties, as well as the friendship and mutual esteem between both leaders,"" an MEA statement said here. President Trump warmly recalled his visit to India in February this year while Modi said that Trump's visit vis-a-vis 'Namaste Trump' mega event in Ahmedabad had been memorable and historic on many accounts, and had also added ""new dynamism"" to the bilateral relationship. The two leaders also exchanged views on other topical issues, such as the COVID-19 situation in the two countries, the situation on the India-China border, and the need for reforms in the World Health Organisation. India along with the US had recently pressed for a probe into the causes those led to the origin of Coronavirus which had originally began from Wuhan in China. President Trump spoke about the US Presidency of the Group of Seven, and conveyed his desire to expand the ambit of the grouping beyond the existing membership, to include other important countries including India. In this context, he extended an invitation to Prime Minister Modi to attend the next G-7 Summit to be held in USA, the statement said. Prime Minister Modi commended President Trump for his creative and far-sighted approach, acknowledging the fact that such an expanded forum would be in keeping with the emerging realities of the post-COVID world. The Prime Minister said that India would be happy to work with the US and other countries to ensure the success of the proposed Summit. Prime Minister Modi expressed concern regarding the ongoing civil disturbances in the US, and conveyed his best wishes for an early resolution of the situation. Mr Modi and Mr Trump had last held tele talks on April 4 and both had agreed to deploy the full strength of the India – US partnership to resolutely and effectively combat COVID-19. Both the leaders also discussed about supply of hydroxychloroquine from India. The June 2 tele talks were also first since escalation of the border tension between India and the United States. Importantly, Eliot Engel, chairman of the powerful US House foreign relations committee, has slammed Chinese “aggression” for continuing tensions along the border with India. “I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control on the India-China border.,” Engel, a Democrat, said in a statement. He has further said - “China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbours rather than resolve conflicts according to international law.” India-Australia ties Meanwhile, government sources revealed to  This will be the first time that Prime Minister Modi would be holding a “bilateral” Virtual Summit with a foreign leader.Since the high-level visit of PM Scott Morrison to India was in the pipeline (13-16 January and later in May 2020), the two leaders decided to continue the engagement even though it was in the form of a Virtual Meeting.  This is the first time that India is holding a Virtual Summit.  Australia has already done one such bilateral virtual summit with Singapore in March 2020. The focus at the talks between Modi and Australian counterpart Scott Morrison would be on the ""positive trajectory"" in bilateral relations. Modi and Morrison have already met on four occasions on the sidelines of multilateral meetings. India and Australia have very warm and friendly relations.

Time for India to call out the nefarious expansionist agenda of Communist China, 03-Jun-2020,,"China’s recent aggression at the border with India at key strategic locations in Union Territory of Ladakh is nothing new nor is its betrayal of historic treaties with (former) J&K, Tibet & HK. However, the dragon now faces a new India that attempts to tame it. China already occupies about 1/5th of original state of Jammu & Kashmir incl. Aksai Chin and Sakshgam valley “gifted” by #Pakistan. However, historically, these parts have been a part of formerly princely state of J&K that officially & legally became a part of India in 1947. Not just J&K but significant parts of Tibet were also controlled by J&K rulers. Here’s the chronology of how China illegally occupied these territories and clearly flouted the treaties signed during these times.  In May of 1841, General Zorawar Singh, under the Sikh Empire, lead a military campaign to extend the boundary of the empire after the conquest of Ladakh to control Trade routes in the region. General Zorawar Singh invaded western Tibet to extend territory as well as to build a connecting road between Ladakh and Nepal for a Sikh-Gurkha alliance against the British. It is estimated that this invasion was a response to attacks on Ladakh by Tibet.  In an astonishing feat, General Zorawar Singh and his men traversed this inhospitable terrain by extending the communication & supply line over small forts and pickets, aiming to regain lost territories of Ladakh to western Tibet, prior to the treaty of Tingmosgang. After occupying Tibetan military posts of Gartok and Taklakot, the Dogra army consisting of Ladakhis, Ksihtwaris and Baltis, was intercepted by the Tibetan army in November, 1841, and a 3-week long battle ensued. It led to demise of the Dogra general.  However, to regain the lost territories, Sino-Tibetan army attacked Ladakh in 1842 but the siege was thwarted by Diwan Hari Chand & Wazir ratnu. Tibetans were defeated by the Dogras in August 1842 which led to the treaty of Chushul. In Sep. 1842, Qing China & Sikh empire signed the Treaty of Chushul that fortified the existing territories and agreed to no transgressions in other country’s frontiers.  On Oct.7, 1950 as the world resisted colonialism & territorial invasions, The  In 1963, Pakistan ceded to China the territories of India it had occupied, namely the Shaksgam Valley. Not only is it illegal for China to occupy Shaksgam but also it’s a key defence location of India that gives us access to sensitive defence areas. china’s occupation and invasion into India’s territories is a strategically planned incision to establish easier links between Tibet and Xinjiang. Recent CPEC deal is a proof of this plan.  From Aksai Chin to Xinjiang to Karakoram Pass through the CPEC, China gets an access to Indian Ocean in the west, completing its String of pearls joining its ports in the Indian Ocean-East. This is the biggest alarm for India that seems to be encircled by the Dragon.

Chinese National Intelligence Law is dangerous for India’s National Security Apparatus, 06-Jun-2020, - Divya Razdan,"The Chinese spy law will affect many verticals like governance, trade, businesses and in-post COVID-19 telemedicine and cyber space in India. CCP uses hybrid warfare toolkit, injecting communist through Social Media platforms targeting youngsters of India to create civil unrest. The military manifesto of PLA on unrestricted warfare is somewhat delineated on the lines of Arthashastra, India’s indigenous knowledge on statecraft, economic policy and military strategy. What is dangerous is that China is using the Niti of साम, दाम, भेद और दंड; meaning the use of the lethal toolkit, commercial spinoffs, usage of hard power and soft power and covert invasions/operations to capture the global market aiming for the economic dominance. Since we are heading towards a new decade from 2020, Hybrid warfare has all the more become prudent for the strategic growth of any country. As the world is busy fighting Chinese virus or COVID-19, China is gaining access to larger domains of trade, commerce, military space and technology through one of its seemingly non-lethal law which is called “National Intelligence Law, 2017” which falls under the purview of its military doctrine as mentioned above. In respect to India, China’s art of warfare is precisely what it’s military manifesto suggests. Chinese National Intelligence Law was adopted at the 28th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 12th National People’s Congress on June 27, 2017. China relatively expedited the spying law to give authorities far-reaching powers to monitor and investigate foreign and domestic individuals and institutions. The tone of the legislation drafted is deliberately kept a low profile. The interpretation of the law can be very ambiguous as nothing much is clearly stated, or if to put aptly, everything is hidden in plain sight. This is classic tactics of China’s Communist Party (CCP). This is also the reason why many international forums, including media house, have questioned this law, but legal authorities of CCP are adequately able to defend themselves. Here, it is essential to note that CCP has wide and deep reach into Chinese telecommunications and other Chinese-owned and operated companies around the world. This is the cause of real concern for India’s National and Cybersecurity apparatus. The risk of Chinese state control globally and with respect to India is not a matter of fiction anymore. The Chinese spy law will affect many verticals like governance, trade, businesses and in-post COVID-19 telemedicine and cyberspace in India. This is a big threat and CCP uses hybrid warfare toolkit very sagaciously. They are injecting their communist ideology into institutions and cyberspace of India through Social Media Networking and other platforms targeting youngsters of India to create civil unrest while defence forces engage into conflicts on border aiming to divert the world’s attention from India’s economic reforms. China’s Tech companies, software and hardware setup in the country actually works as ground stations for spying the data and exporting it to China. This is nothing short of weaponizing the telecommunication industry leading to Cyber Terrorism. Considering the Chinese deep reach in the country through emerging technologies gives strategic advantage to CCP’s trade deals for Border Road Initiative (BRI) other sectors. The major concern regarding the telecommunication sector is the 5G technology where China wants to hold dominance in the world. One of the ICT giant Huawei recently declared in a media briefing that if the Chinese government would ask to hand over 5G data to them, then Huawei would be compelled to do so. This comes into effect after the induction of China’s Intelligence Law 2017, which states that “support, assist and cooperate with the state intelligence work”. Primary investigation on 5G by countries like the US, Japan and Australia have already decided to block the Chinese telecommunication equipment maker from providing hardware for this next-generation mobile network. Smartphones with such network capabilities are no less than Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and if not taken seriously can lead to critical consequences in the near future.  China’s Tech companies, software and hardware setup in the country actually work as ground stations for spying on data and exporting it to China. This is nothing short of weaponizing the telecommunication industry leading to Cyber Terrorism. It is interesting to note that CCP also adopted other laws like targeting counter-terrorism, counter-espionage, foreign non-profits and cybersecurity. This only indicates massive level surveillance under the law and subsequently implicating concerns over National Security. For example under General Provisions of National Intelligence Law, 2017, Article 11 states that” National intelligence work institutions shall lawfully collect and process relevant intelligence on foreign bodies, organizations and individuals engaged in, or inciting or assisting others to engage in, or domestic bodies, organizations and individuals who collude with foreign bodies, organizations or individuals to engage in harm to the national security and interests of the People’s Republic of China, in order to provide intelligence as a reference and basis and reference for preventing, curbing and punishing the above acts.” Another Article 14 states that National intelligence work institutions, when carrying out intelligence work according to laws, may ask relevant institutions, organizations and citizens to provide the necessary support, assistance and cooperation.” There are so many articles as mentioned above in the law, and hence, it becomes all the more prudent for the government of India to take strong measures on urgent basis. Chinese Networking is that undercurrent which deeply works into global geopolitics, impacting its influence forcefully or otherwise. China’s economic ambitions are affecting the indigenous sectors of the country. Therefore, VOICE FOR LOCAL as campaigned by PM Shri Narendra Modi seems to be well thought out counter-strategy to counter China. Few rudimentary solutions charted out to stop the Chinese intrusion are as follows:  Empowering the Local infrastructure, commercial market and demands. There are many aspects related to Chinese’s intrusion in Indian cyberspace threatening the National Security, which can be dealt with integrated warfare toolkit. Aggregation of data which is basically an informational network through apps and service indicates that most of it are Chinese. In short, the Internet of Things (IoT), which we commonly know is a non-kinetic weapon which is nothing short of a WMD in today’s scenario. This not only controls digital space but also the geopolitics, societal, ideological, technological and other infrastructures in the country. Chinese’s invasion needs to be annihilated by the pragmatic application of self-reliance. Here, the Israeli model of innovation can be an inspiration for India to fuel its R&D, technological capabilities, tactical engagements and operations. India on urgent basis needs to have strategic leveraging in military diplomacy, bureaucracy, technological R&D, and legal access to counter China’s intrusion in the country.

The malevolent dragon : From Tiananmen Square to Belt and Road Initiative, 05-Jun-2020,,"The land of dragons resembles, in reality, a coconut wherein the outer brown shell and the inner white marrow are in complete contrast. China’s much hyped and advertised ‘One Belt One Road (OBOR)’ initiative is exactly like this coconut.  - Deepanshu Aggarwal This article is the first piece in a three-article series that will talk about China’s malevolent expansionary plans under the garb of its much touted and advertised Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The project is being used by China to entrap the participating countries into a debt-trap. This article, the first, talks about China’s debt-trap diplomacy in Africa, followed by the second article that’ll talk about Asia. The third article, last in this series, will summarize China’s BRI and its hidden geo-strategic implications. The word “China”, as the website dictionary.com says, means “a translucent ceramic material..”. In reality though, there is hardly anything ‘translucent’ about China. From its domestic politics to international diplomacy, China thrives on its opaqueness. The land of dragons resembles, in reality, a coconut wherein the outer brown shell and the inner white marrow are in complete contrast. China’s much hyped and advertised ‘One Belt One Road (OBOR)’ initiative is exactly like this coconut. On the outset, China wants the world to see OBOR as an economic, trade-related, diplomatic and humanitarian infrastructural initiative that will benefit the participating countries. However in reality, the project is dragon’s gimmick to dupe other countries into falling in a debt trap. This makes OBOR similar to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in one important respect : crushing competition or dissent (whether domestic or international) to march towards a Sino-centric world with the Communist Party of China reigning supreme. The project started when, as an article in The Diplomat mentions “over a course of two speeches in the final months of 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced each leg of what would then go one to become China’s “One Belt, One Road” (OBOR) initiative. In September 2013, during a visit to Kazakhstan, Xi unveiled what went on to become the centerpiece of China’s foreign and economic policy. Xi introduced the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB), which, along with the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (MSR) announced a month later in Indonesia, came to be collectively known as OBOR. By 2017, OBOR had been fully rebranded as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).” The OBOR is touted as the mechanism through which various European, African and Asian countries will receive infrastructural facilities such as railway lines, seaports, roads etc. in their countries. However, in reality, erecting those “infrastructural facilities” have come at a great cost to several participating countries : their sovereignty. China financed these projects by lending trillions of dollars, through its ‘Export Import Bank of China’ to various countries. This ‘benevolence’ soon turned into a ‘debt-trap’ when the countries were unable to repay the huge amount of loans, causing the Chinese government to own a stake in the infrastructure so erected in these countries. “Mission accomplished” for the dragon? The threat of losing sovereignty to China is most grave in Africa and Asia. The former necessitates special mention because of its abundant natural resources (ranging from diamond to gold), weak infrastructure and constituent weak nation-states - a perfect recipe for China’s invasive manoeuvres. Today, China is Africa’s biggest lender and trading partner, far outstripping the US in its trade with the continent. China today has a $200 billion trade relationship with Africa. As an article in the magazine mentions “According to McKinsey, over 10,000 Chinese-owned firms are currently operating throughout the African continent, and the value of Chinese business there since 2005 amounts to more than $2 trillion. Africa has also eclipsed Asia as the largest market for China’s overseas construction contracts. To keep this momentum building, Beijing recently announced a $1 billion Belt and Road Africa infrastructure development fund..” Behind these astounding numbers lies an alarming story of countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, Djibouti losing out their domestic infrastructure assets to China. The most recent example is that of the Kenyan seaport of Mombasa, a critical asset located at a critical juncture on the East Africa. Kenya risks losing Mombasa port to the Chinese if it defaults on its payment of Kenya Shilling 71.4 billion ($705 million) in the current fiscal period to the China EXIM Bank. (Gateway House report) The report mentions that under OBOR, the Standard Gauge Railway between Mombasa and inland Nairobi has been developed and has put Kenya into a debt trap due to high interest rates and other costs (The China EXIM Bank granted the $3.2 billion loan for building the railway line at an interest rate of 5.6%, to be repaid in 15 years with a grace period of five years. This is much higher than the Libor rate of 2%. The Chinese, while negotiating for the railway line development, had insisted for Mombasa being part of that line, wanting “the Kenya Ports Authority to be the guarantor if the Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) defaulted in its obligations The 472-km Mombasa-Nairobi SGR cost the Kenyan government $3.6 billion.” The Kenyan government is finding it extremely tough to repay the huge amount of loan it has received, bringing the Mombasa port closer to being taken over by China. This would make China control the sea traffic of East Asia to whose east lies the critical Indian Ocean. China is already trying to place a ‘string of pearls’ (as the strategy is called) around India in order to choke its access to the Indian Ocean. This is akin to what happened in the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota, wherein the port’s majority stake has passed on to China upon Sri Lanka’s failure to repay the loan using which the port had been developed. Multiple other African nations such as Nigeria, Madagascar etc. have fallen into this Chinese debt trap in the name of OBOR and other infrastructure projects. Thus, in the guise of One Belt One Road initiative (later Belt and Road Initiative), China is hiding its real geostrategic, geographic, territorial and political ambitions. Its utter disregard for the rules led international order stems from its age-old belief wherein China is at the epicentre of multiple concentric circles that together resemble a Sino-centric hierarchical world order. This hierarchical system is applied to its domestic politics too, wherein the centre position is occupied by the ruling Communist Party of China. This philosophy steers the party led government to crush dissenting voices and democracy in its country. The same philosophy, that led to the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 wherein protesting students/people were killed by the People’s Liberation Army for campaigning for pro-democracy reforms, is behind China’s increasingly aggressive behaviour on the diplomatic front. Thus, in its complete writing off of respecting the other nations’ sovereignty, China has used OBOR to further its global footprints by making other nations debt-trapped.

In response to Dubey's questions, Dr Jaishankar has written a letter on June 1st highlighting the MEA's response in the USCIRF matter. India has rejected the US organisations observations as inaccurate and unwarranted and also mentioned that USCIRF had chosen to be guided only by its prejudices and biases on a matter on which it has little knowledge and no locus standi. EAM says that USCIRF has been known to make prejudiced, inaccurate, and misleading observations regarding the state of religious freedom in India.""We do not take cognizance of these pronouncements and have repudiated such attempts to misrepresent information related to India"", says EAM's letter to Dubey. Further confirming the denial of Visas to USCIRF officials, EAM's letter states ""We have also denied visa to USCIRF teams that have sought to visit India in connection with issues related to religious freedom, as we do not see the locus standi of a foreign entity like USCIRF to pronounce on the state of Indian citizens' constitutionally protected rights.""

Sanskar Bharati resolution demands a system to enact laws to curb web series which hurt Bhartiya society and nation, 17-Jun-2020,,"With allegations of Hinduphobia, Hindu hate and being anti-national against several web series on various online platforms increasing each day, the RSS inspired Sanskar Bharati has urged the government to bring in a system to enact stringent laws to curb creations/productions which hurt the delicate fabric of Bhartiya society and the nation as a whole. Sanskar Bharati made this demand as part of its resolution at its Akhil Bhartiya Prabhandh Karini (ABPK) on 7 Jun 2020. Sanskar Bharati's resolution categorically states that in the guise of artistic freedom, many web series' often feature scenes of openly hateful violence, sexuality and nudity, along with scenes tarnishing Hindu Dharma and criminalizing Hindu values. Bhartiya army and their families which has a strong place of honour and respect in the minds of our citizens, is also shamelessly and recklessly portrayed as derogatory, says the resolution. ""ABPK firmly believes that this is another well-planned conspiracy to hurt and damage our social systems and beliefs in the garb of artistic expression. Since, there is no proper system of regulation on these mediums, they misuse this unlimited freedom to take these mediums to the extent of anarchy"", says the resolution. Though we support freedom of expression but only as far as human sensibilities, traditional values and national identity are not hampered, it says. Quoting Bharatamuni’s Natyashastra, the resolution says that audio-visual mediums should be designed to shape, guide, educate and positively influence the society to be better and the stories and plays should be aimed at giving relief to the tired, pained and those afflicted with fatigue and grief. However, these mediums should not display any disrespectful, embarrassing or shameful acts as families sit together and watch, it says.

In the same breath, the resolution condemns the chaotic freedom that is flourishing under the guise of freedom of expression and expects art, literature, culture and followers of Bharat and Bhartiyata to boycott such free, vulgar works and acts. In conclusion, ABPK demands from the government that there should be an immediate system to enact stringent laws to curb such kind of creations/productions, which hurt the delicate fabric of Bhartiya society and the nation as a whole.

Chinese dissident Jianli Yang writes that revealing true number of casualties in Galwan clashes could lead to domestic unrest and put CCP's regime at stake, 06-Jul-2020,,"Unverified sources corroborate Jianli Yang's claims of higher casualties as it shows a list of 108 Chinese soldiers killed in the Galwan Clashes. Jianli Yang, a Chinese dissident in USA, has claimed that CCP regime could be at stake if the true number of casualities in the Galwan clashes is revealed Jianli Yang, a Former Chinese military official and presently a dissident residing in the USA, has disclosed that unrest is brewing within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) ever since the Indian Army inflicted heavy casualties on its troops. He has attributed this to the fact admitting that PLA had lost troops, that too more in number than its opponent, could lead to major trouble and domestic unrest, that the very regime of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could be put at stake. In an article in the Washington Times, Yang accused that the Chinese government is not willing to disclose the PLA casualties in the Galwan Valley conflict. He wrote that the spokesman of the Chinese foreign ministry who had earlier given a 'step-by-step' account of the clashes, later dodged the questions regarding the Chinese casualties during various news conferences. Yang writes that while China has even refused to publicly admit that there had been casualties on its side, India paid homage to its martyrs with full state honors. Yang is the son of a former Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader and a  Tiananmen Square activist. After 5 years of incarceration in a Chinese Prison, he was released in 2007 when he defected to the USA. Indian Army killed 108 Chinese troops that day! List claimed to be that of 108 Chinese casualities in the Galwan clashes Close on the claims of Jianli, unverified sources have put out a list of 108 Chinese soldiers killed in the Galwan Clashes. The list which has gone viral on the internet, does not distinguish between killed in action or wounded in battle. Chinese spokesperson have neither accepted the list or rejected the same altogether. They have been tight-lipped on the number of casualties. It can be recalled that India had readily put out the list of its soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice while defending its borders and were laid to rest with full state honors. At the same time, Indian intercepts had revealed that Chinese side had suffered 43 casualties the same night including dead and seriously injured the Galwan valley clashes. The subsequent casualties were however not counted. Trouble brewing in CCP after Galwan clashes Yang has on several occasions revealed the duplicity and untrustworthy nature of the CCP. In his Washington Times article, Yang presents the plight of the PLA soldiers. ‘It is better not to think of the state of the retired Chinese army personnel when China does not care for the serving soldiers and martyrs from the Chinese military. The Chinese government frequently treats the retired soldiers, who participated in the 1979 China-Vietnam or the Korean war, with contempt. These soldiers are protesting against the communist government for pension, medical facilities and employment, for the last many years. But the Chinese government is not willing to take cognisance of their demands', he writes in the article. Saying that the Xi Jinping government takes action against any soldiers who protest for their pension and other demands, he cites protests held by retired PLA soldiers against Jinping in various cities including Beijing. Yang also claims that there is anger brewing among the PLA soldiers against Jinping due to this attitude. Jianli Yang's article in the Washington Times He then says that the CCP is now worried that in this scenario, if it is announced that the number of Chinese soldiers killed is in multiples of the number of Indian soldiers, Xi will have to face a backlash and the retired soldiers, taking advantage of the situation, could attack the Chinese government. Yang says that Xi is well aware that if the Chinese soldiers rebel against him and the CCP, the government will not be able control the situation and hence they are trying to suppress the facts and appealing them to have faith in him. However, the such a truce is short-lived and Xi might face a rebellion soon say other sources.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/6/Chinese-dissident-Jianli-Yang-Galwan-clashes-could-lead-to-domestic-unrest-and-put-CCP-regime-at-stake.html

While China has officially claimed to have eradicated plague, its re-occurrence in a region illegally occupied by it have given rise to doubts if it is yet another biological experiment of China to be unleashed on the world just like the Wuhan Virus. Chinese news agency Xinhua had reported that Mongolia had also confirmed two cases of Bubonic plague last week where brothers who had eaten marmot meat in Khovd province were found infected. Authorities in the Bayannur district of occupied Mongolia raised the plague warning on Sunday. The residents were ordered not to hunt wild animals such as marmots and to send anyone with fever or showing other possible signs of infection for treatment. China is yet again accused of hiding crucial information of the plague which could be much worse that what is being reported from the region. The Wuhan virus has killed over 5 lakh people across the world with nearly 12 million affected from the virus. But both China and WHO failed to alert the world on time, resulting in the deadly pandemic the world is suffering today. The latest outbreak of Bubonic plague has all the features of the Wuhan virus episode from last December. Bubonic Plague can be fatal in up to 90% of people infected if not treated on time. Doctors believe that delay in detecting the plague can be deadlier than Wuhan virus. WHO absolving China again? Reacting to the reports of Bubonic plague in China occupied inner Mongolia, WHO has characteristically said  case was being ""well managed"" by China and it does not consider it to be of high risk. WHO had used the exact words to describe Wuhan virus in December 2019. And in January 2020 WHO had claimed that there were no proof of human-to-human transmission of Wuhan virus. Later it changed its version but absolved China repeatedly. Few days ago, a WHO official said that the Wuhan virus could be airborne for longer periods than suspected. The WHO has repeatedly changed its stance on the nature of Wuhan virus and experts hope that WHO is not committing the same mistake again with respect to the Bubonic plague cases reported in China occupied inner Mongolia. As of today, neither China nor WHO have asked people outside the province to be tested for the plague. The true extent of the spread is unknown or if any travelers from China have carried the virus already. Airports and point-of-entries in all countries will prepare to test for the virus only after their country's medical body alerts them based on WHO's recommendation. However, given WHO's reputation during the Wuhan virus spread, countries have to be prepared to handle yet another virus from China on their own.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/8/China-planning-to-unleash-Bubonic-plague-on-the-world-after-Wuhan-virus.html
"China's environmentally hazardous Three Gorges Dam in danger of collapse, say experts; Warn people in lower reaches to brace for evacuation", 08-Jul-2020,,"Satellite images of the dam over the years show structural disintegration which could cause its eventual collapse (Image source: oilprice.com) The Three Gorges Dam built on the river Yangtze River has been deemed a a environmentally hazardous project right from its beginning given its geographical position and its effect on earth plates. Now, China's own renowned hydrologist  Regional rainstorms and mudslides that began in early June have uprooted more than 7,300 houses and affected nearly eight million people by the end of the month. The nonstop heavy rains had raised the Chinese public's concerns over the potential damage caused to the world's biggest hydro-power project. But Chinese authorities and government have been tight lipped over these concerns and have not revealed their plan of action in case of any damage. They have maintained that the dam is structurally safe. Hydrologist Wang Weiluo is not convinced of the government assurances and has claimed that the facility is not as stable as many have been led to believe. Wangs concerns over the condition of the dam was r Wang pointed out that the dam's design, construction, and quality inspection were all carried out by the same group of people and that the project was finished too quickly. He said that the Three Gorges Dam is not equipped to handle the rise in the river water levels and will have a limited effect on flood control. This was confessed by Chinese Vice Minister of Water Resources Ye Jianchun at a June 10 press conference where he said that water levels of at least 148 rivers in the country have risen above warning thresholds. Wang warned that if the dam is forced to control flood due to rising water levels, it could give way leading to a catastrophe. Wang also said that the cracks and substandard concrete discovered during its construction is a serious concern. He said a failure of the dam would have catastrophic consequences for individuals residing in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and that they should prepare for evacuation as soon as possible. Chinese stated-owned CNTV, itself had reported that water inside the Three Gorges Dam continues to accumulate and has risen two meters above its flood-prevention level. China's propaganda machinery hails the dam as one of the greatest engineering achievements in human history, but experts have always questioned its structural integrity. Environmentally hazardous from the Beginning Hydrological experts had warned of the dam being environmentally hazardous due to several factors. Two uniquely identified hazards with the dam were the unviable sedimentation projections and seismic fault on which the dam sits. 80% of the land in the dam area experienced soil erosion, depositing about 40 million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually, a fact that was ignored by the Chinese government. Hydrologists had warned during construction that they expect downstream riverbanks to become more vulnerable to flooding. They had also warned that the sediment buildup could cause biological damage and reduces aquatic biodiversity. Erosion in the reservoir, induced by rising water, have caused frequent major landslides that have led to noticeable disturbance in the reservoir surface. Two incidents in May 2009 confirmed this when somewhere between 20,000 and 50,000 cubic metres (26,000 and 65,000 cu yd) of material plunged into the flooded Wuxia Gorge of the Wu River. The dam has also affected the forest cover, wildlife, and terrestrial impact  and its waste management is also under a cloud.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/8/China-Three-Gorges-Dam-in-danger-of-collapse-say-experts.html
"'Will Kill Each And Every Hindu If Temple Built In Islamabad’, warns a Pakistani child", 07-Jul-2020, ,"“I will kill all the Hindus” said a brainwashed kid in a video posted by the handle @Exmuslimorg on twitter. In the video, a Pakistani man makes his kid display bigotry over the construction of a temple in Islamabad. Islamic Organisations in Pakistan had recently opposed the construction of Shri Krishna temple which is the first Hindu temple in the capital Islamabad. A fatwa was also issued against its construction. -Yatharth Sikka The controversy over the construction of a temple in Islamabad rose after a video was posted on social media, wherein two kids, of about 5 or 6 years, were heard giving death threats to Hindus alongside with their father. The Pakistani man was seen taking pride in the venom spewed by his kids. In the video, a man tells that his son has a message. One of the two says, “Khan sahab, agar Islamabad mein mandir bana to yeh yaad rakhna, main un Hinduon ko chun chun ke marunga. Samajh gaye? Allah Hafiz. (Khan sahab, if a temple is constructed in Islamabad, then remember, I will kill all Hindus one by one. Understand? Allah Hafiz.)” The other, the much younger kid next to him, too chimes in and endorses his brother. The man identifying himself as the father of the kids then says, “See, now it is up to you."" The Construction of the first Hindu temple in Islamabad has unleashed large-scale Hinduphobia in the Islamic republic. The construction work was stopped by the radical Islamists and the boundary wall of the temple plot was also dismantled by extremist organisations. Another Pakistani Haider Ali commented on the post ""I'm a Pakistani and I can reassure you that 90% of Pakistanis think the same way as these people do"". He further mentions ""In a society which is 99% Muslim, all sharing the same beliefs and convictions, people who have been fed lies about ""kaafirs"" over and over, it's hard to see how that ""awakening"" is ever gonna happen.

Chinese professor who criticised Xi Jinping over his handling of Corona pandemic and called him a dictator detained as his whereabouts remain unknown, 08-Jul-2020,,"Chinese law professor Xu Zhangrun was detained on July 6th for criticising Xi Jinping A Chinese law professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University, Xu Zhangrun, who had criticized Xi Jinping over his handling of the Corona pandemic in the country has been officially detailed. But his family says that his whereabouts are unknown and the authorities are not keeping the family informed about his condition. Prof. Xu Zhangrun who is also a jurist was  Xu in an online essay attributed the severity of China's pandemic situation to Xi's lack of leadership. He also lambasted Xi for trying to cover up information about the pandemic and predicted that China's economic slowdown would cause a ""decline of national confidence"" as well as ""political and academic indignation."" He then wrote that the outbreak reflected systemic problems in the country which the government fails to address. As per Chinese online new portal New Talk, Xu had published an online essay titled ""Imminent Fears, Immediate Hopes"" in 2018 where he condemned Xi for pursuing totalitarian powers similar to those of former Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Chairman Mao Zedong. The professor had blamed Xi for the country's recent economic and cultural regression in the essay and noted that Xi's intention to remove the two-term limit on his office showcased his dictatorial attitude. Xu's family says that they are being targeted by the Chinese authorities and are stigmatised with false allegations made by the authorities. Chinese dissents continue to disappear Xu is the latest victim of Chinese totalitarian regime under Xi Jinping. He became the latest Chinese dissident to be silenced for his views and detained at a unknown location. After doctor Li Wenliang who exposed the cover-up of Wuhan virus outbreak was detained and stigmatised, many other activists who spoke up against the government and President Xi have been arrested or have disappeared after being detained. In April this year, Two Chinese activists Chen Mei and Cai Wei, were detained for almost two months for sharing censored material about the early days of the coronavirus outbreak. They were set to face trial on criminal charges but the government is dragging the case and they are still in prison. The two activists were running a online project that published material about issues like #MeToo movement, eviction of migrant workers in Beijing apart from exposing the cover-up of Chinese virus cases in November and December last year. In March, Chinese Tycoon Ren Zhiqiang who criticized Xi’s response to Coronavirus pandemic disappeared. He had called Xi Jinping “a clown who stripped naked and insisted on continuing to be an emperor.” The US has expressed 'deep concerns' over Xu's detention and demanded his immediate release. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus who stated the US stance, also urged the CCP to respect the freedom of expression. Highlighting the tightening ideological controls on university campuses in China, the US spokeswoman said that 'PRC must release Xu and uphold its international commitments to respect freedom of expression'.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/8/Chinese-professor-who-criticised-Xi-Jinping-over-his-handling-of-Corona-pandemic-detained.html
Chinese Apps & their fake-news spreading strategy, 08-Jul-2020,,"After India banned 59 Chinese apps, China also banned access to Indian news media as confirmed by the Indian Newspaper Society. INS demanded a ban on Chinese-owned news websites and apps in India.  Indian news websites can't be accessed even from a virtual private network in China because they have used a technically advanced firewall to block Indian news media China is anyway infamous for blocking or censoring foreign media. It forced Tibet flag to be blurred in Bollywood movie Rockstar.  Similarly, Taiwanese flags were removed from Tom Cruise's jacket in Top Gun sequel- Maverick China indulges in censorship of foreign media or outrightly bans it, but you know what’s most dangerous?  Chinese regime actively suppresses anti-China news and spreads fake news in other countries such as India.  Two apps that spread fake news, censored anti-China news, propagated CCP’s narrative in India are UC News and Newsdog. Both these apps have been now banned. UC News positioned itself as a general news application. Not a single news that can challenge CCP’s narrative could be found on the platform. But, UC news always had fake news on Indian leaders, communal riots and Anti-CAA and NRC protests.  Similarly, NewsDog app owned by a PhD from Princeton University and a graduate from Tsinghua University used blockchain technology to spread its wings in India. It paid people to read the news.   Unlike UC News that positioned itself as a general news application, Newsdog positions itself as an entertainment app. But in the name of entertainment, it served pornographic content with rape videos and communally sensitive material.  Most Chinese apps, including even Shareit, had a dedicated “news” tab where they offered regional content in Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam. Imagine the damage China was causing. I spoke to a couple of journalists who were hired or interviewed by these apps.  The management even the HR execs, were always Chinese.

Our claim goes beyond that. When it comes to J&K, it includes PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) and when it comes to the UT of Ladakh, it includes Gilgit-Baltistan and Aksai Chin,” said Bharatiya Janata Party general secretary Ram Madhav on Wednesday. Ram Madhav was speaking at an interactive session on India-China Border Issue organised by Organiser Weekly, on June 24. He said the solution to the present standoff is actively engaging with China both diplomatically and militarily. India’s assertiveness on its side of the LAC is required to “protect its self-respect”, Madhav said. He also added that the country will have to defend its land till the last inch. Ram Madhav underscored that India does not want to wage a war against China, but pointed out that China, as we see today, is more aggressive. “Be it Rajiv Gandhi in 1988, Narasimha Rao in 1993 or Deve Gowda or the UPA government, all tried to make peace with China only to be betrayed by the dragon,” he said, adding that the neighbouring country, by nature, never wanted to settle a border dispute. In an introductory speech, Senior RSS functionary Shri Ram Lal said, ""There are elements in this country who seem to be playing into the hands of China. They are destroying the morale of our forces.” In a brutal Chinese attack, twenty Indian soldiers were martyred at Galwan Valley on June 15.

China's jittery response to banning of apps by India; Talks of mutual benefits and cooperation, 01-Jul-2020,,"On June 29, Government of India blocked 59 Chinese apps including Tik Tok for engaging in activities detrimental to sovereignty and integrity of India. The move came weeks after Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre had sent an exhaustive recommendation for blocking these malicious apps. In response to India banning the Chinese apps, Chinese Embassy in India has issued a statement saying that 'Chinese side is seriously concerned with and firmly opposed to such action'. Calling India's move as 'selective and discriminatory', the statement says that banning Chinese apps runs against fair and transparent procedure requirements and violation of WTO rules. China further tries to put up a brave face by bringing in its 'concerns' for Indians post the ban. Saying that these apps 'operate strictly in accordance with Indian laws and regulations', the statement adds that the ban will affect not only the employment of local Indian workers who support these apps, but also the interests of Indian users and the employment and livelihoods of many creators and entrepreneurs. But the statement indicates that China is willing to wilt down in wake of losing revenue and following from Indians when it says that it expects India acknowledges the mutually beneficial nature of China-India economic and trade cooperation, and urges the Indian side to maintain the momentum of China-India economic and trade cooperation. In mid-June, Indian intelligence agencies has asked government to block 52 Chinese mobile apps including Zoom, TikTok, UC browser, Xender, SHAREit, Clean-master and had advised people to stop using them over concerns that these weren’t safe and also for extracting large amount of data outside India. China has never categorically denied that Chinese apps to not steal data and it has also not come clean on the requirements it mandates for its apps in other countries. China has also not allowed apps like Facebook, Google, Twitter in its own territory and has also blocked these websites. China's demand to allow its apps while banning apps from other countries in its territory is sheer hypocrisy say China observers.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/1/Chinas-jittery-response-to-banning-of-apps-by-India.html

Now China picks up boundary dispute with Bhutan too; Objects to developing the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in eastern Bhutan for being in a 'disputed area'!, 06-Jul-2020,,"The hegemonic territorial claims of Communist China seems to have no end and does not seem to leave even small countries like Bhutan. On July 6th, China objected to Bhutan's plan to develop the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district at an online meeting of the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Hitherto, China had never claimed any dispute in this region although it had disputes in north and western regions of Bhutan. Bhutan had sought funding from the GEF for developing the wildlife sanctuary. China which is part of the GEF objected to the project stating the sanctuary lies in a 'disputed area'. The Chinese representative is reported to have said, ""...in light of the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary in the project ID 10561 is located in the China-Bhutan disputed areas which is on the agenda of China-Bhutan boundary talk, China opposes and does not join the Council decision on this project”. However, not to be taken lying down, Bhutan strongly objected to China's claims at the meet. The Council member for the Constituency of India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka requested that the views of Bhutan be reflected as follows: “Bhutan totally rejects the claim made by the Council Member of China. Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary is an integral and sovereign territory of Bhutan and at no point during the boundary discussions between Bhutan and China has it featured as a disputed area”. Consequently, much to China's chagrin, the GEF discarded it's claim and sanctioned the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary project. The sanctuary is located in the easternmost part of Bhutan and was never contested by China in the past. After the loss of face, the Chinese foreign ministry in a statement said — “The boundary between China and Bhutan has never been delimited. There have been disputes over the eastern, central and western sectors for a long time, and there are no new disputed areas. China always stands for a negotiated package solution to the China-Bhutan boundary issue.” Though India, which is part of GEF, has not reacted to the developments officially, sources say that the foreign ministry and the Indian embassy in Bhutan are in touch with officials there and are monitoring the situation closely.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/6/China-objects-to-Bhutan-developing-the-Sakteng-wildlife-sanctuary-.html
Nepal’s Changing Priorities in Foreign Policy - Reasons and Motivation, 07-Jul-2020,- Devesh Jha,"K.P.Sharma Oli and his kitchen cabinet are trying to create a bitter environment so that distancing theory of western forces can be implemented. The current scenario is the continuation of the strategic game plan where India has to compete with China, US, EU and Pakistan in Kathmandu to dilute it’s interests. Chinese Ambassador in Kathmandu, Hou Yanqi is said to have “inspired” PM Oli to redraw Nepal map in order to antagonise India Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli accused Indian establishment of conspiring for his removal from the office. On the occasion of birth anniversary function of former general secretary of the then UML late Madan Bhandari he bitterly responded about the ongoing meet of NCP permanent committee. He argues that all it was made due to his efforts on making agreements with Chinese counterparts. Everyone was taken aback when Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli made these remarks. He visited India and had a meeting with high-level political leaders and intellectuals in India and had cordial relations with the Indian establishment. Personally too, PM Oli had his first kidney transplant in India with the support of Indian establishment. However, recently Nepal-India relations are taking a different turn and intellectuals feel that PM Oli’s remarks are responsible for these new developments. The recent tension in Nepal-India relation began when Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh tweeted about the inaugural event of a road linking to China border near Kalapani. Nepal claimed India constructed the road through the land of Nepal and streets of Kathmandu valley witnessed violent protests. Media, student unions and civil society started making the atmosphere hot. At first, PM Oli, in an interview with a national TV channel, said that he never read anything about the claimed territory belongs to Nepal. Suddenly it became a national issue, and leaders of different political parties started making opinions on Kalapani. At the same time, Oli was in big trouble within his party, and the issue of territory brought a recovery for him. A cabinet meeting directed the concerned minister to submit a full-size map of Nepal including the claimed territory. However, Nepal and India have prepared 182 sheets of boundary maps earlier besides Kalapani and Susta. As per the agreed boundary maps, Nepal and India have begun the demarcation of the border, which was likely to be completed in 2022. Within days all the documents made clear and endorsed by the cabinet. Then questions about the national stamp arouse and need for a constitutional amendment was sought. That was too is done in a week. The Parliament passed the amendment on soon. Indian media had a lot of speculations about this sudden development in Nepal. Some speculations indicated it to China favour policy of Nepal whereas others claimed it to be irresponsible behaviour of Indian media. Media developed imaginary theories of Nepal-India relations based on their speculations. Some speculated the present situation has its connection with the twelve point’s agreement made with Indian assistance whereas others speculated the blockade of 2015 was responsible. Some even rumoured that, if the situation got worse, there could be blockade and these rumours spread widely through social media in Nepal. On May 15, Indian Chief of Army Staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane remarked that Nepal might be raising the issue of road construction via Lipulekh to Mansarovar by Indian authorities at the “behest of someone else”. Talking in a webinar, General Naravane, without naming China, said on last Friday, “There is reason to believe that they might have raised this issue at the behest of someone else and that is very much possible.” The road constructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is on the west side of Kali River. So, I do not know what exactly they are agitating about,” he added. Narvane’s statement escalated protests against India in the streets of Kathmandu. Indian media speculated this ‘behest of someone’ to be China. Based on such speculations, Indian media repeatedly claimed the role of China for the recent development of Nepal-India relations. Coincidentally, in the meantime, Sino-India territorial conflict escalated in Laddakh. Much of Indian media started looking at Sino-India conflict, and Nepal-India border issues strategic and parallel development and they put forward the government of Nepal led by Nepal Communist Party as the hard-core evidence for it. On the other hand, Nepalese media found it to be humiliating. Both Indian and Chinese establishments indeed attempt to influence the political establishment in Nepal. After the fall of the royal regime in Nepal, Chinese strategically increased their influence on Nepal. This caused a power imbalance between Chinese and Indian ideologies, i.e., one-party system communist regime of China and West ministerial multi-party parliamentary system of India. Before 1990, the party-less panchayat system of Nepal had a balanced foreign policy, particularly with immediate neighbours. The movement in 1990 brought a drastic change in the political system in Nepal. Nepal endorsed a multi-party parliamentary system with the constitutional monarchy after the promulgation of a new constitution that was not accepted by Chinese in a cheerful mode, but they avoid making any remarks. The Indian side always doubted relations between Nepal and China. Time and again Indian media blamed Nepal for using China card, a baseless accusation to Nepali political system, against India. Whenever Nepalese leadership get closer with the Chinese leadership, this provokes bitter speculations in Indian media. Speculative and provocative outbursts in Indian media has become a regular phenomenon that Nepal has moved to the side of China. Although a lot of such speculative outbursts have been aired in India media, no one has substantive evidence and convincing arguments to prove exact Chinese engagement with affairs in Nepal. Indian establishment claims that the road Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated had a long history of trade between India and China since British Raj in India. On May 15 2015, India and China issued a joint statement stating the expansion of border trade through Lipu-Lekh pass. Clause (28) of the statement clause says, “The two sides recognised that enhancing border areas cooperation through border trade, pilgrimage by people of the two countries and other exchanges can effectively promote mutual trust, and agreed to broaden this cooperation further to transform the border into a bridge of cooperation and exchanges. The two sides agreed to hold negotiation on augmenting the list of traded commodities, and expand border trade at Nathu-La, Qiangla/Lipu-Lekh Pass and Shipki-La.” When China and India reached an agreement to build bilateral trade corridors through Lipu-Lekh via the Indian state of Uttarakhand in 2015, Nepal took up the issue with both countries. The Government of Nepal wrote to both New Delhi and Beijing about the agreement, but neither New Delhi nor Beijing responded to the concerns of Nepal.  India started the construction of the road via Lipulekh, the disputed region, quite a long time ago but Nepal did not interfere, neither Chinese had a say on this matter. The issue became a matter of public interest when Indian Defence Minister inaugurated the road. Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, the leader of Nepal Communist Party argued the issue to be settled with a trilateral talk with Nepal, China and India. Immediately Chinese authorities rejected it outright. They called the Nepalese diplomat at Beijing and communicated that it was a bilateral issue between Nepal and India Further, in an interview with the official media of Government of Nepal, the Chinese ambassador to Nepal made the stand of China clear on this issue. India knows that the construction of the road to Kailash Mansarovar boosts the pilgrim tourism in not only the region but also accessibility to the region will offer a high turnover in economic activities along with huge India-China trade. Moreover, China sees the road instrumental in reaching its goods to the vast Indian market. Financial issues determine modern bilateral matters. When India started the construction of the road to Kailash Mansarovar, China knew that the road opens South Asian market to Chinese goods. The strategic geo-political importance of Nepal between China and India has drawn the attention of international powers. This is the region that very often western powers show interest in the affairs of Nepal and manipulate in many different ways. This manipulation began when the British arrived in the Indian Sub-Continent, and this got intensified in the post-colonial era because of the vested interest of the western powers such as the US and the European Union. Strategic regional enterprises of India and China such as BIMSTEC of India led group and BRI of Chinese initiation often put Nepal under challenging situations as both the powers wanted to secure relationship with Nepal. In addition to these regional powers, Nepal also has to face the interests of the western powers, for example, the issue of MCC at present. To fulfil their interest, these powers manipulate Nepali politics by offering a huge amount of financing in infrastructure and, in return, they want to secure their presence in the region. On January 11, 2019, Phill Davidson, the commander of US Indo Pacific Command, visited Nepal. After his visit, a report published on the strategic defence planning of America for Nepal. The document highlights the future plans including counter-terrorism, defence professionalisation, ground force capacity, peacekeeping operations etc. The document also clarifies regular visits of high-level Defence personnel. From events of this sort, it is evident that western powers understand the geo-political position of Nepal and they want to make their presence here for the regional manipulation at the time of conflict. Nepal’s geographical location makes it impossible for the western powers to establish any strategic movement without the consent of two Asian giants of India and China. To settle its interest, the US manipulates Nepal strategically with regional consent. Because of ideological differences with China, the US has no option other than India as a regional power that supports the US interest. The INGO/NGOs also manipulate politics and policymaking in different ways. These INGO/NGOs get involved in political processes by manipulating leadership. To understand the strategic games deeply, we have to know the relationship between INGO/NGOs and leadership of Nepal. This country’s geo-political position is always a major concern for western forces. They continuously involved in the political process, even in the monarchy regime. Funding for developments was a dilemma tactic to shadow their hidden agendas. Even Maoists insurgency was started just the next day after the closing of “Unified Rapti Multipurpose Project”. There are peoples worked in INGO’s previously are still alive who set up the office in Rolpa, the headquarters of Maoist. Leaders of different political parties are directly involved with western funding through NGO. Their spouse or nearby relatives operate most of them. In the early days of the multi-party parliamentary system, India tried to engage in various hydropower projects like ‘Arun valley’ and ‘Pancheshwar’. But then demonstrations, debates were started to disrupt those and the whole scenario was arranged by NGOs which was operated by these leader’s relatives. Again the same is happening in Nepal. Now NGOs have severely damaged their image due to corruption; western forces are directly engaging with political parties. EU and US-sponsored politicians are acting as per guidelines. Nepali Congress leadership is more open with western political leaders, whereas there seems to be a vertical line with Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in the ruling party. PM Oli, defence Minister IshworPokharel, foreign minister PradipGyawali and finance minister Dr Yuba Raj Khatiwada with their supporters are in favour of it. In contrast, former PM Jhalanath Khanal, former defence minister Bhim Rawal with internal support of Prachanda kitchen cabinet are among the opponents. If China highly influences PM Oli and his kitchen cabinet, then how could they insisting pressure to accept MCC, which is very well known about the strategic plan for the US. Meanwhile, Kathmandu based US Embassy is the first diplomatic mission publishing constitutionally amended map of Nepal on its official Face book page could explain very much. Right now Nepal is passing through a political crisis as the senior members of the ruling party asked the resignation of the Prime Minister. President Bidya Devi Bhandari with the recommendation of PM Oli call an end of the budget session for this fiscal year. There are big chances of re-implementation of introducing notification for amendment of the constitution to make softness in the act of division for political parties. By this action PM Oli can open easy access for division in his party NCP to form NCP(UML), already in the process for registration in the election commission and could be able to form an alliance with Nepali Congress which had already endorsed a vote of support for MCC in its parliamentary party or others who are supporting MCC. Chinese prefer direct actions in Nepal because they didn’t trust leadership. After the publishing of an article against them in Kathmandu Post, its editor Anup Kafle had to resign. And some says that was the root cause for the resignation of information minister too. Recently Kantipur daily had to issue an apology in a humiliating manner for the news of territorial violations of China in the northern border of Nepal. In early May there was a violent protest of Chinese nationals before Nepal’s secretariat Singh Durbar. They brutally misbehaved with Nepalese police officers, but the leaders had to keep mum on it. India published its new map on November 2, 2019, after Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh were created by splitting the former state of Jammu and Kashmir. The map also showed the region of Kalapani as part of the Indian territory. A press meet was called by foreign minister Pradip Gyawali on November 3 at hotel Marriot in Kathmandu where he ignored to reply to a query regarding this. Similarly, a program arranged in Pakistan embassy to show staggered on it attended by several leaders including the then chairman of Federal Socialist Forum, Upendra Yadav. On November 4, 2019, the Kathmandu Post featured a story claiming Lipu-lekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani as part of Nepalese territory. On November 6, 2019, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kathmandu released a statement saying Kalapani is a part of Nepalese territory. The press release came on Ministry’s letterhead with an unauthorised signature. On November 7, 2019, a group of students affiliated to Nepali Congress protested shouting anti-India slogans in front of Indian Embassy. Actually, after the 1990 movement in Nepal, western forces are eagerly waiting to put forth their agenda for secularism, but due to the continuation of monarchy, it was unacceptable. Finally, they got the chance for this after 2006 when re-established Parliament passed a bill for secularism even not a single political leader is ready to accept the ownership for this till now. Nepalese peoples never accepted that, and it is remaining a big question for society. The Supreme Court of India declared the final judgment in the Ayodhya dispute on November 9, 2019, ordered the disputed land (2.77 acres) to be handed over to a trust (to be created by Government of India) to build the Ram Janmabhoomi (revered as the birthplace of Hindu deity, Ram) temple. As the Supreme Court of India verdicts in favour of Ram Mandir, there was a chance to get igniting a momentum of Hindu state and to demotivate the people of Nepal; a big game plan was played strategically. Now a day’s western forces propaganda tarnished Indian image very badly in Nepal. They are making a controversial scenario and conspiring for breaking age-old traditional ties. There are voices to cause permanent detachment and closing of the special relationship on both sides, which is sponsored by the same sector. Nepal’s PM Oli is continually trying to provoke India as he commented in Parliament on national emblem of India, used cheap words, amended map but not getting any harsh response from the south, he again goes for teasing the law of nationality. Suddenly parliamentary committee became active to clear the amendments in law for nationality act. They focused on the issue of the naturalised action in which a woman of foreign national married to the Nepali citizen can get naturalised citizenship after seven years only. Previously it could be available just after starting the process of leaving her native country’s citizenship. Right now Nepal has a population of approximately 30 million, and nearly 21.2 million have already got the citizenship certificates with only 325 thousand are having naturalised citizenship which clearly shows that there could be no chance of any adverse impact due to it. Most of naturalised citizenship holders are from India, but the geography of marital migration is not only from southern plains as it is claimed. Nepalese peoples are married in India from the east in Darjeeling, Assam and Kumaon, Garhwal at western side equally. There is a misconception that moreover Madhesi are only marrying Indian brides. It would be better to understand and accept that almost every family in Nepal has an Indian bride in their house. All this hue and cry is made to increase the anti-Indian feelings only. K.P.Sharma Oli and his kitchen cabinet are trying to create a bitter environment so that distancing theory of western forces can be implemented. The current scenario is the continuation of the strategic game plan activated in November last year. India has to compete with China, US, EU and Pakistan in Kathmandu to dilute their vested interests. The US want to deploy its forces, EU has the responsibility for fulfilment of Vatican’s wishes, Pakistan is interested in the humiliation of India and for China, and all are getting free of cost. Western forces, including the US, must make a big gap with an extremely bitter relationship between Nepal and India socially till BJP led govt is in the centre so that the chances of revocation for Hindu state Nepal may be pushed far and to achieve the strategic target they are sponsoring both sides. Regarding map issue, Indian media is presenting itself with a theory of belief that every anti-India movement is designed and directed by China, which may be one angle of the scene. But far behind it, there is a deep-rooted mission for the continuation of secularism because only that will be a solid base to relay and execute strategic programs staying between majorly Hindu populated India and Buddhist populated Tibet, illegally occupied by China.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/7/Nepal-Changing-Priorities-in-Foreign-Policy-Reasons-and-Motivation.html
Residents of Pak Occupied J&K protest against China and Pakistan over illegal construction of dams over Neelum and Jhelum rivers, 07-Jul-2020,,"Residents of Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (POJK), are protesting against the hydropower plant being built illegally on the Neelum and Jhelum rivers. The residenst took out a protest rally condemning the project on July 6. The participants of the rally shouted slogans against Pakistan and China for the illegal constructiion. The protestors spoke to the media and said that the construction of the dam would adversely affect the environment. The protestors informed that a social media campaign has been launched to save rivers of Jammu and Kashmir and to educate the world about the issue. The social media campiagn is also aimed that telling the world as to how badly Pakistan is treating POJK and its residents. POJK is used only for its own benefit and has done nothing for the common citizens of the region, said a protester. The illegal dam over Neelum and Jhelum are part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which is desgined to benefit Pakistan and China and nothing for the rsidents of POJK, opined the demonstrators. The protesters at the rally said that the agreement has already been reached between Pakistan and China over the dams and they had no say in it. This will not be allowed to happen at the cost of the enviroment and lives of the people of POJK they said. The residents of Muzaffarabad also said that the area in which they are building the dams are disputed and China-Pakistan have no legal rights over the area to build them. They said that they will take out a rally till the Kohala project area where the dam is being built in order to protest. The protesters said that rivers are being illegally occupied for the CPEC which is a violation of the UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution. It can be recalled that recently, a Chinese company, the Government of China and Pakistan signed a tripartite agreement worth $ 2.4 billion for the 1,124 MW hydropower project in Kohala.

Is Nepal Going the Tibet Way?, 09-Jul-2020,- Major General Mrinal Suman,"Ties between Nepal and India are age-old, deep and intense. They encompass religious, cultural, social and spiritual planes. Every Indian wishes Nepal and the Nepalese people well. That is why Nepal’s rapid drift towards the Chinese quagmire is viewed with great concern in India. It is a trap that can only lead Nepal to its doom. Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli with Chinese President Xi Jinping Signs are ominous. Nepal is certainly going the Tibet way, but with a fundamental difference. Tibet was militarily annexed in 1950 and close to one million Tibetans have been killed by the Chinese to suppress their demand for freedom. In the case of Nepal, self-serving politicians are handing over the country to China on a platter. Nepal is being economically, politically and culturally colonised. If the current trend continues, Nepal will soon follow Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) to appear in the maps as Nepal Autonomous Region (NAR) of China. Slavery has many connotations. A proud Hindu nation will become a Communist colony due to the mechanisation of unscrupulous and power-hungry politicians. As per the press reports, China is already calling the shots. It is deciding which politician should rule the country. In other words, the present ruling dispensation owes its existence to the Chinese ambassador in Kathmandu. She is the real ruler and all politicians look up to her for favours and directions. A boundary dispute with India has been raked-up only to curry Chinese favour. With the signing of agreements worth USD 2.4 billion for various projects, Nepal is getting into a deadly debt trap like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Maldives and many African countries. Eventually, the Chinese financial stranglehold will jeopardise its existence as an independent nation. Concurrently, China is pursuing cultural invasion as well. It has offered financial assistance to those schools that teach Mandarin. Needless to say, the bait has been swallowed hook, line and sinker. Several schools have already decided to make Mandarin a compulsory subject. Nepal’s future appears bleak. It is just a matter of a decade, or two and Nepal will cease to exist as an independent nation. It will be an autonomous region of China, i.e. NAR. The saga of Tibet’s subjugation helps us make objective forecasts. Here are a few key parallels. TAR Today Tibet is autonomous only in name; the Chinese Government exercises total and unbridled control. The locals have no say. Even though TAR has an ethnic Tibetan as the Chairman, he is only a titular figure. He is subordinate to the Branch Secretary of the Communist Party of China, the real power wielder, who is always from the Chinese mainland. The Chinese Government considers demographic swamping to be the ultimate solution. The Han population is likely to overwhelm the locals in the next two decades. Tibetans are not issued passports and hence cannot visit other countries. Even for visiting mainland China, they need a special permit. Every street and building in Tibet is embellished with innumerable Chinese flags as if to continually remind the locals that Tibet is under the Chinese rule. Similarly, billboards read ‘Welcome to China’s Tibet’. Chinese Flag over Potala Palace, Lhasa Every house is mandated to fly the Chinese flag on the rooftop; and its height must be more than that of the Tibetan prayer flags that traditionally adorn all houses. Non-compliance is construed as an act of defiance of the state authority and is dealt with harshly. Punishment may include imprisonment for anti-national proclivity. Lhasa-Shigatse Highway Lined with Chinese Flags China has been systematically annihilating Tibetan culture and religion. Their places of worship and learning have been methodically targeted. Over 6,000 monasteries have been destroyed or ransacked. Damage done to Tibet’s relics, heritage and architecture has been truly horrendous; and beyond redemption. Buddhists need police clearance to congregate to celebrate their festivals. Local authorities regulate the number of monks that a monastery can accommodate. Monks need official permission to visit other monasteries in large numbers. Armed soldiers invariably accompany them to monitor their activities. Under the garb of decongesting, demolitions have recently been carried out at Larung Gar Buddhist Academy, the biggest Tibetan Buddhist institute (academy and monastery) in the world. Monastery with Chinese Flag As the Chinese consider the knowledge of Mandarin to be essential for building national cohesion, the Tibetans are compelled to learn Mandarin. As a result, the local Tibetan language is being allowed to die. Most signboards are in Mandarin. The Chinese behave like the rulers and treat the locals with disdain. The Hans from mainland China occupy all senior government posts and are running prosperous businesses. On the other hand, the Tibetans have been condemned to menial jobs. All janitors, sweepers, load carriers and labourers are Tibetans. It is sad to see a once-proud community degraded to the status of bonded labour. Poverty continues to afflict most. NAR of Tomorrow No crystal gazing is required to visualise the future of Nepal. The elected representative of the people of Nepal will only be figure-head/puppet. The Branch Secretary of the Communist Party of China from the Chinese mainland will call the shots. Visitors at the Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu will be greeted with a billboard reading 'Welcome to China's Nepal'. A Chinese flag will fly over the Singha Durbar in Kathmandu, as it flies on Potala Palace in Lhasa. Even the hallowed Pashupatinath Temple may be forced to fly the Chinese flag, as all monasteries are mandated to do in Tibet. All main roads of Kathmandu will be duly decorated with the Chinese flags. All signboards will be in bold Mandarin, with Nepalese in small font. Over a period of time, Nepalese will be replaced by Mandarin as the main language. All religious places will come under the Chinese scanner. Hindu practices and customs will be discouraged. Religion is an anathema to the Communists. As has been done with the selection of Panchen Lama in Tibet, China may select the Royal Kumari Devi of Kathmandu. The Hans from mainland China will swamp Nepal to change demography. They will hold all positions of importance and thrive economically, whereas the local Nepali population will be forced to undertake low-paid manual work like sweeping roads. As is their won't, the Chinese will behave like the rulers and treat the Nepalese as pitiable subjects. NAR will undoubtedly benefit in terms of infrastructural development. Kathmandu, which is perhaps the most underdeveloped and filthiest capital city in the world, will undergo a drastic transformation. Also, huge concrete structures will come up to house the Chinese soldiers. Some sceptics may consider the above prognosis to be speculative, improbable and far-fetched. They should see the accompanying pictures, taken by me in September 2016. The sight of the Chinese flag lording over the Potala Palace, the hallowed seat of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal head of the Buddhists, was heart-wrenching. The narrative of Tibet's tragedy is a saga of brutal decimation of an ancient, rich and peace-loving culture by vicious China. Tibet is a state under foreign siege. A similar fate awaits Nepal. Conclusion Ties between Nepal and India are age-old, deep and intense. They encompass religious, cultural, social and spiritual planes. Every Indian wish Nepal and the Nepalese people well. That is why Nepal's rapid drift towards the Chinese quagmire is viewed with great concern in India. It is a trap that can only lead Nepal to its doom. A land of proud people with ancient civilisation certainly deserves to thrive as an independent nation. History is most unforgiving. The die once cast cannot be undone. Similarly, freedom once lost is extremely difficult to regain, especially from a ruthless tyrant like China. It may be the last opportunity for the people of Nepal to pull their country back from the precipice. (The writer commanded an Engineer Regiment on the Siachen Glacier.

Hindu community protests in front of Broken Chair in Geneva against the ongoing persecution of minorities in Pakistan, 11-Jul-2020,,"On July 10, the Hindu community protested in front of Broken Chair in Geneva against the ongoing persecution of minorities in Pakistan. The protests come during the ongoing 44th session of the UN Human Rights Council. The protesters called for the UN to take steps against Pakistan to stop atrocities against minorities, especially Hindus and Sikhs. The protesters called for stopping of abduction of Hindu girls, institutionalised torture of Hindus in Pak and forceful conversions to Islam. They also called upon the UNHRC to demand implementation of Human Rights in Pakistan and stop the genocide of Hindus there. The protesters who arrived at the venue held placards with slogans of their demands. Ironically, Pakistan is one of the members of the UNHRC, representing the Asia-Pacific states. Murders of Hindus, abduction of underage girls, forced conversion and marriage of Hindu girls to Muslims have almost become the order of the day in Pakistan. Ever since Imran Khan took the reins of the Islamic country, the atrocities have been on a over drive and minorities, especially Hindus have been forced convert or flee to India to avoid persecution. During the last few weeks alone, since the outbreak of Corona across the world, atleast 50 cases of rape, torture, abduction, forced conversion to Islam, forced marriage of Hindu girls, discrimination against Hindus in other forms have come to the fore.

"China continues to attack Buddhism in Tibet in the name of Environment, 'Ethnic Unity', eradicating Superstition and Tourism", 13-Jul-2020,,"Apart from brute force to quell the Tibetan freedom movement, China has used several methods to force Tibetans to adhere to its policies and even forced them to be part of its anti-Buddhist campaigns which are done in the name of Environment, Patriotism, 'Ethnic Unity' and Tourism. China illegal occupation of Tibet is coupled with its relentless attack on Tibetan Buddhism and traditional practices China has not only occupied Tibet but has been trying to undermine the very soul of Tibet i.e Buddhism. Though the Communist occupier's campaign to rid Tibet of its Buddhist identity has been going on for decades, it has literally gone on the overdrive ever since Xi Jinping took the reins of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Few recent campaigns by the Chinese government in Tibet prove its efforts to subvert Tibetan religious practices and traditions. The Chinese government is so fearful of the Buddhist traditions that in May this year, it banned Tibetan students and officials from Buddha celebrations in order to limit the influence of Buddhism on young people. China's attacks against Tibetan culture in recent times include the abduction of the Panchen Lama, whose whereabouts are still unknown. Apart from brute force to quell the Tibetan freedom movement, China has used several methods to force Tibetans to adhere to its policies and even forced them to be part of its anti-Buddhist campaigns which are done in the name of Environment, Patriotism, 'Ethnic Unity' and Tourism. In the name of Environment  Tibetan monastries and villages have been ordered by the Chinese authorities to remove prayer flags as part of 'environmental clean-up drive'  In June, Chinese authorities ordered the removal of Tibetan prayer flags from the mountains, monasteries and villages in the Tibetan Province of Golog in eastern Tibet. The  occupying authorities ordered local Tibetan citizens and monks to remove the flags, labeling it part of an  environmental clean-up drive, reported Free Tibet portal. The orders have been carried out even in Machen county and other areas of Golog Province. The so-called 'environmental clean up drive' began in March and has continued since, say Free Tibet sources. The Tibetan prayer flags are part of the Tibetan culture for centuries. They are traditionally hung in Tibetan areas on rooftops of homes, monasteries, mountains and holy sites. They represent prayers to ward off evil, spread good fortune and good health. The practice of hanging prayer flags is also part of many Buddhist traditions even in India, especially in Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and other areas. Anti-Buddhist campaign in the name of 'Ethnic Unity'  In order to promote its new 'Ethnic Unity' law, China is using monastries to brainwash people to further its hold on the people of Tibet  Last month, Free Tibet reported that the Chinese Communist Party is attempting to promote its new Ethnic Unity Law across western and central Tibet, the areas renamed as the so-called Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) after it illegally occupied Tibet. The Chinese are using the Monastic Management Committees to give impetus to their anti-Buddhist campaign which aims to 'promote patriotism' among the Buddhist monks. The Ethnic Unity Law, which was passed in January this year and came into force in May, makes it mandatory for “ethnic unity” to be promoted between Tibetans and other ethnic groups. Tibetan experts who have analysed the law opine that this is the latest in a series of efforts by the CCP to forcefully merge Tibet into the People’s Republic of China. During the campaign, heads of Monastic Management Committees request all the monks to take the initiative to consciously 'oppose separatism', claiming it was their duty to safeguard a 'united China' and to 'be patriotic'. On 12 June, in order to ensure that the vicious policies of the CCP takes root in Tibetan monasteries, the Monastic Management Committee organised a campaign forcefully in hundreds of Buddhist monasteries and monks were forced to be part of it. At the 'Ethnic Unity' events, Tibetan monks are forced to state that they would safeguard the 'unity of motherland' and 'oppose separatism', and work towards building a shared spiritual home for a 'Chinese nation'. This is not the first time that the CCP is trying to brainwash the Buddhists in Tibet. The CCP has tried to promote its so-called policy of 'ethnic unity' in a number of different ways, including a recent drive to encourage marriage between Tibetans and Han Chinese people. In the name of eradicating Superstition Chinese authorities distribute pamphlets 'educating' people on “underworld forces” and religious superstition (Image source: Free Tibet)  In May this year, the Chinese government launched a anti-Buddhist campaign  During this anti-Buddhist campaign, police officers and other authorities cracked down on online communications in at least two townships in the Qinghai Province even as the world was grappling with Wuhan virus outbreak. The online communication in the province was digitally searched in around 16 villages and five monasteries in Mangra County. Authorities shut down many Buddhist chat groups across the two townships. The campaign has resulted in hundreds of arrests across Chinese Occupied Tibet. Anyone found discussing about Dalai Lama, sharing Buddhist Practices not favorable to China, and criticising the government have been arrested. Destroying Buddhist sites in the name of Tourism Satellite images  In September 2019, Satellite images acquired by Free Tibet showed large-scale demolitions at Yarchen Gar in Eastern Tibet, one of the largest Tibetan Buddhist sites in the world. The images show that the Chinese had leveled almost half of Yarchen Gar which is located in Palyul Province in eastern Tibet. As per reports, the demolitions were done since August last year and was part of a long-term effort by CCP authorities to decrease the number of residents at the site. Before and after satellite images reveal the demolitions that shows a clear contrast on the west bank of the river running through Yarchen Gar. The images reveal a bare ground where a densely populated area of the community once resided on. In addition to the demolitions, Free Tibet portal reports that thousands of monks and nuns were also forced out of their homes and places of worship in Yarchen Gar. In July 2019, Tibet Watch confirmed that 70 nuns were evicted from Yarchen Gar while local sources claimed there have been at least 3,500 removals that year. All the monks and nuns who were removed from Yarchen Gar were detained and forced to undergo patriotic re-education. Patriotic re-education is a strategy enforced by the CCP where the detainees are compelled to praise the People’s Republic of China and denounce Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. The monastic township in Yarchen Gar was established in 1985 by the Tibetan community to help the monk and nuns to live and practice their faith without hindrance. Over the years, the population of the monastic community here grew to an estimated 10,000 people. The community is sometimes known as “The City of Nuns” due to the large proportion of resident being nuns. This was an eyesore for the occupying Chinese regime which saw the growing number of monks and nuns as a threat to its occupation. Using tourism as a tool, the CCP has now destroyed not just a monastic township but also one of the largest Tibetan Buddhist sites in the world. Free Tibet reports that the demolitions have continued despite the repeated appeals of Buddhist monks and nuns at Yarchen Gar. The key reason for the demolitions and removals is to open Yarchen Gar up to tourists, shows the photo evidences. A hotel and several car parks have been constructed to the north of the community and roads have been widened to facilitate access. But this is not the first time that Buddhist sites have been destroyed by China in the name of Tourism. Between June 2016 and May 2017, at least 4,800 people were forcibly evicted and 4,700 buildings, mostly residences, were torn down in Larung Gar province of Tibet. Hotels were constructed in their place and roads widened to help tourists.

PM calls for a reformed multilateralism with a reformed United Nations at its center, 18-Jul-2020,,"Speaking at the High-Level Segment of ECOSOC, PM Modi said that motto of ‘SabkaSaath, SabkaVikaas, Sabka Vishwas’ resonates with the core SDG principle of leaving no one behind. PIB Delhi: Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi delivered a keynote address virtually at this year’s High-Level Segment of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) session on Friday, 17th July 2020 at the United Nations in New York. This was the first address by PM to the broader UN membership since India’s overwhelming election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council on 17th June, for the term 2021-22. The theme of the High-Level Segment of the ECOSOC this year is “Multilateralism after COVID19: What kind of UN do we need at the 75th anniversary”. Coinciding with the 75th Anniversary of the founding of the UN, this theme also resonates with India’s priority for its forthcoming membership of theUN Security Council.  Prime Minister reiterated India’s call for a ‘reformed multilateralism’ in a post-COVID-19 world, which reflects the realities of the contemporary world. In his address, PM recalled India’s long association with the ECOSOC and the UN’s developmental work, including for the Sustainable Development Goals. He noted that India’s developmental motto of ‘SabkaSaath,  SabkaVikaas,  Sabka Vishwas’ resonates with the core Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) principle of leaving no one behind. Prime Minister pointed out that India’s success in improving the socio-economic indicators of its vast populationhas a significant impact on global SDG targets.He spoke about India’s commitment to also support other developing countries in meeting their SDG targets.

Prime Minister also highlighted India’s focus on environmental sustainability and bio-diversity conservation, and recalled India’s leading role in the establishment of the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. Speaking about India’s role in its region as a first responder, Prime Minister recalled the support provided by the Indian government and Indian pharma companies for ensuring medicine supplies to different countries, and for coordinating a joint response strategy among SAARC countries. This was the second time that Prime Minister addressed the ECOSOC. He had earlier delivered the keynote address at the 70thanniversary of the ECOSOC in January 2016.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/18/PM-calls-for-a-reformed-multilateralism-with-a-reformed-United-Nations-at-its-center.html
Border Regulation in the post COVID-19 World, 23-Jul-2020,- Dr. Rajeev Kumar,"The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us of two things: the ‘challenges of globalisation’ and the ‘significance of borders’. The current pandemic is teaching border agencies important lessons about operational preparedness in times of crisis. Borders, in the human history of movement, became crucial elements in an increasingly global system of states with globalisation permeating the notions of deterritorialized and borderless worlds. In a world of unimpeded global flows, especially flows of capital and information, borders were considered as being redundant. Concomitantly, borders remain the most sensitive elements of territorial states; the sites where preventive actions are taken in the face of threats. As the threat level increases, so also is the pressure on border regulation and management. In the present scenario, when Covid-19 pandemic has triggered an unprecedented chain reaction of border closures around the world in an effort to stop the spread of virus, the message seems clear: the borders need to be redefined within the framework of security not only from traditional threats (security implications of migration, international trafficking and terrorism) but also from non-traditional threats like the Corona virus. This is simply because of the fact that these threats, knowing no borders, are defined in cross-border or trans-national terms.  Thus, the recent economic/security discourses propound contrasting visions of the border as agents of national policies, one striving to ease restrictions to strengthen economic prosperity, the other aspiring to impose more stringent restrictions as a means of strengthening security and safety. This has become more evident in the form of present global crisis, i.e. Covid-19 pandemic. The whole concept of borderless world with minimum barriers and interconnected markets across borders has, somehow or other, been at stake imminently. ‘Re-imagining’ Border Regulation The location of the border has been shifting for decades when it comes to regulating mobility and access. This is part ‘of a strategy that strives to ‘push the frontier out’ as far away from the actual territorial border as possible. This involves screening people ‘at the source’ or origin of their journey—not the destination—and then again at every possible checkpoint along the way’. The conventional static border is, thus, reimagined by the governments as the last point of encounter, not the first. Responses to the global pandemic have accelerated this trend worldwide, i.e. identifying and addressing threat at the earliest possible point and not at the actual border. This becomes pertinent in the prevailing situation when most of the countries around the world are closing their borders indefinitely, thereby raising the question of whether border controls/regulation of pre-Covid days will prove to be effective in containing such outbreaks in the post-pandemic world; and on the preparations of the border agencies for such exigencies. The primary task when it comes to reinforcing borders in response to the corona virus is to keep the movement alive together with balancing the health risks. Such bold measures may be justified today as a matter of urgency to combat a global pandemic. But they also ‘reveal deeper patterns that disrupt and test assumptions about waning sovereignty, while also revealing the limits of the populist push for border-fortification. The shifting border not only extends the reach of sovereign authority to regulate movement far beyond the country’s actual territorial edges, it also bleeds into the interior. As part of a major reform to U.S. immigration policy in the 1990s, a procedure called “expedited removal” was introduced into law. This legal provision permits frontline officers and border agents both to expeditiously return undocumented migrants at the border and to review the legal status of individuals detected up to one hundred miles away from any U.S. land or coastal border, in effect “moving” the border into the territorial interior’. The corona virus Covid-19 makes us ask once again if the border should be viewed as a protective shield. Is it still such a good idea to erect borders against the spread of this new and currently untreatable disease? Now borders must be defined differently: as a health and safety mechanism of the utmost importance. The border is not, thus, dissipating but rather metamorphosing. Far from the dream of a borderless world, today we witness not only more border walls but also the rapid proliferation of “movable” legal barriers that may appear anywhere but are applied selectively and unevenly, with fluctuating degree, intensity, and frequency of regulation. Instead of waning and disappearing, states have engendered a whole new legal cartography of control over borders and movement. No longer a static and immovable barrier, the border has transformed to become a mobile, agile, sophisticated, and ever-transforming legal construct—a shifting border, which can be planted and replanted in myriad locations, with dramatic implications for the rights and protections of those falling under its remit. Technology comes to the Rescue: ‘Saving’ Mode While most of the countries are turning inwards for fighting this pandemic, the use of technology becomes an essential part of it; saving lives of people not only by direct use of it but also by recognizing the ‘other’ and thereby restricting the mobility of the population. The use of artificial intelligence could, thus, help avoid physical contacts in situations when physical distancing is required for the prevention of infections. Increased use of contactless equipment (fingerprint scanners, facial recognition cameras, etc.) and robotic voice commands would enhance the health security of both border guards and travellers. Technology could also help solve some of the conflicting objectives of border security agencies, which must not only reconcile secure but speedy border checks and ensure cost-effectiveness but also the convenience for travellers. There will be a need to add additional parameters, e.g. by equipping e-gates with body temperature measuring devices and expand their installation to arrival halls at border crossing points. Such e-gates would provide an early warning system to take the necessary precautions in a timely manner. With the spread of Covid-19, a growing number of countries are also turning to cyber-tech measures, viz. deploying surveillance tools, for regulating the movement of their own citizens. The once-fixed territorial border is, thus, not just shifting inward and outward, but also multiplying and fracturing. Government officials foresee a future whereby arriving and departing passengers will not require any travel documents. Instead, the body will become the ticket of admission as biometric borders expand their reach. Australia, Japan, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates are leading the way. The current crisis has, thus, led to the reimagining of national sovereignty and international cooperation. Borders will have to fit in the same parameters. Borders post COVID-19: A Line to ‘link’ or ‘separate’? Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measure. While the evolving situation of a pandemic requires the strict state measures to control the epidemic and is not to be questioned but the nature and extent of the measures need to be scrutinized. Everyone has the right to the highest attainable standard of health, and governments are under the obligation to ensure that in the times of epidemics and other exigencies under international law. Open borders are must to ensure this uninterrupted standard of health to be maintained. But is the price going to be too high or not is the question that looms large? The corona virus Covid-19 makes us ask once again if the border should be viewed as a protective shield. Is it still such a good idea to erect borders against the spread of this new and currently untreatable disease? Now borders must be defined differently: as a health and safety mechanism of the utmost importance. Are border closures an effective way to protect public health? This question is undoubtedly going to arise. Once again, nations must reassume control of their borders in order to protect the health and safety of their populations. Let us not talk about closing national borders, but rather specific measures for when they are crossed. In order for these measures to be effective, careful coordination is required. Strengthening checks on people crossing the border becomes essential. Essential to this new discourse, and constituting a remarkable change, is the systematic control of every person entering a nation via its external borders. The borders are now “viscous”, so that infected people can be caught and isolated. The free movement of information can also be seen in the search for a treatment for Covid-19. The lack of a convincing response from liberalism (and the somewhat more effective response from the authoritarian regime in China) suggests that it may be time for systemic change, taking into consideration the negative consequences of ‘full globalisation’. The rapid onset of the global pandemic, from one Chinese city to the whole world, underscores the need for controls at the border. Travelers quickly carried the virus to practically every corner of the globe, and many governments were forced to shut down borders in order to contain the outbreak. Border authorities are faced with the daunting challenge of stopping the virus at the border while allowing trade to flow without impediment. Though pandemics are the spillovers of globalisation, but to harvest the benefits of globalisation, one has to manage the risks. The biggest job to be done in the world ‘post COVID-19’ will not be to build walls or impede global integration but to make globalisation work for more people than ever before. At the same time, the regulation of entry must happen in transit hubs that may be located miles away from the actual border. While extraordinary measures such as restrictive mobility, social distancing, and even preventive quarantine appear to be the necessary call of the hour, we will also need to proactively undo the draconian surveillance and control measures that this virus has unleashed without hesitation. COVID-19 and India India is one of the worst affected countries in terms of spread of the virus and overall number of cases. Though India has succeeded in managing the pandemic better than many well-equipped and developed nations; the current extraordinary situation calls for severe measures as the virus is having an enormous impact on safe, orderly and regular migration and cross-border mobility. Migrants and mobile populations are heavily affected and are finding themselves in vulnerable situations. The preparedness and response efforts of the Indian government, therefore, must include assessment at the country’s land, sea and air border crossing points. Monitoring border movements together with countries sharing open border with India, e.g. Nepal, has become a necessity now. The process of reverting to regular mobility across international borders will take time as states will gradually assess the extent to which the corona virus is contained. The rapid onset of the global pandemic, from one Chinese city to the whole world, underscores the need for controls at the border. Travelers quickly carried the virus to practically every corner of the globe, and many governments were forced to shut down borders in order to contain the outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us of two things: the ‘challenges of globalisation’ and the ‘significance of borders’. Though the border performs the dual role of a line that links as well as a line that separates; as of now it seems to separate. The current pandemic is teaching border agencies important lessons about operational preparedness in times of crisis. This has implications for the future in terms of training, staffing, cross-border information sharing and the use of technologies. India also must learn the lessons from the current pandemic and work towards securing the borders from all kinds of threats in the foreseeable future. In times marked by trends as diverse as economic globalization and COVID-19 pandemic, the efficient handling of borders has become an issue of political priority across the world. It is widely agreed that in a globalizing world, borders should be as open as possible; yet in the post-corona days, world governments would understandably be more anxious than ever to ensure that their frontiers are secured against external threats, especially threats like Covid-19 which know no borders. Thus, recognizing that goods, services and lawful citizens need to flow freely across borders, an increased level of vigilance and interdiction must be maintained with good border management practices, including technological upgradation, in order to help ensure the sanctity and security of borders whether physical or virtual. Better cooperation between border guards, customs services and sanitary agencies will also be needed. Better cooperation on early warning and risk assessment, viz. the need to share information across borders, including threat perception and risk analysis, will be quintessential as part of policy-making. Modernisation also needs to happen downstream so that operational staff has better access to virtual platforms to improve the flow of real-time information and raise overall preparedness at the borders. * References 1.Ayelet Shachar, ‘Borders in the Time of COVID-19’, Ethics & International Affairs, Carnegie Council, March 2020.

India exposes Pak's fake claim of statement at UN Security Council, 27-Aug-2020,,"Pakistan's UN envoy Munir Akram (file photo) There is nothing new about Pakistan when it comes to peddling lies and faking propaganda against India on a respected stage like the United Nations. Islamabad was caught off-guard after India formally exposed Pakistan’s lie on when its envoy Munir Akram claimed of making a statement in a Security Council meeting on terrorism, which was not open to non-Council members. New Delhi, on Monday took a strong note and formally wrote to the UN to put on record about Islamabad's claim that it had made a statement in the Security Council, which is false wherein the Security Council meeting that was not open to non-members of the 15-nation UN body. Pakistani Mission falsely claimed that its UN envoy had given a statement at the Security Council debate on Report of the Secretary General on Threats to International Peace and Security posed by Terrorism Actions. But it may be noted that the Security Council meeting on threats to international peace and security was not open to non-members of the Council. Secretary General on Threats to International Peace and Security posed by Terrorism Actions Further busting Pakistan’s lie, Indian envoy on Islamabad’s claim of it being the victim of cross-border terrorism said that “a lie repeated a hundred times will not become truth. The biggest sponsor of cross-border terrorism against India now tries to masquerade itself as a victim of terrorism by India.” Later on, Akram's claim that Pakistan has cleared al-Qaeda from the region, India said perhaps the Permanent Representative of Pakistan is “not aware that Osama bin Laden was hiding in their own country in plain sight, and it is the US forces which got him inside Pakistan. Nor have they heard their Prime Minister refer to Osama bin Laden as a martyr.” India added that Pakistan is home to the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN and many of the sanctioned terrorists and entities continue to operate with impunity inside Pakistan. In fact, Imran Khan himself had admitted at the General Assembly last year about the presence of 40,000-50,000 terrorists inside its borders. Slamming Pakistan on the lies that “India has hired terrorists to hit them” was “laughable” and that too it came “from a country which is a known sponsor of cross-border terrorism which has made the world suffer due to its actions, this claim is nothing short of being preposterous!” Pakistan was shamed further when the Indian mission strongly decimated Akram’s lie one at a time. On clarifying further, about Indian nationals in the 1267 al-Qaeda Sanctions List of the UN Security Council, India said the Sanctions List is “public and the world can see none of these individuals are in it."" On the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, India said Pakistan makes “ridiculous assertions” about internal affairs. Peddling lies is in Pakistan’s nature and it does not shy away from doing it in the UN, but it has never succeeded in gaining support. Islamabad has done that before when Pakistan's former permanent representative to the United Nations, Maleeha Lodhi in 2017, held up a photograph of a scarred girl at the assembly, where she said that she was offering proof of ""Indian brutality"" in Kashmir. But the photo turned out to be that of a 17-year-old Palestinian girl, taken in Gaza in 2014 by award-winning photographer Heidi Levine. The teenager had been injured by shrapnel in an Israeli attack. Adding on to the insult on Pak envoy’s lies of brutality on minorities, India said that “this is a country whose minority population has dropped drastically from 1947 to what it is today, which is just about 3 per cent, which is nothing short of systemic cleansing. This is in addition to false allegations about India's sovereign actions in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which are for the welfare of the people.” (News sourced from www.jammukashmirnow.com.

"""Corona's Father will have to be crushed completely"" says VHP in a scathing attack on China; VHP salutes the martyrs and appeals Indians to boycott China", 18-Jun-2020,,"Saluting the valour of Indian Army soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice in the battle against Chinese occupationst forces in Galwan in Ladakh, the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) today has said that the feudalistic and expansionist greed of China would now leave it globally isolated. In a press statement issued by VHP's Central Secretary General Shri Milind Parande earlier today, the VHP said that China must understand that the one with whom it has messed up is not the Bharat of 1962 but of 2020 whose capable leadership, military strength and unity of countrymen, the world is well aware of. The entire world have also now come to discern and see through the Chinese greed, wickedness and conspiracies which used the Chinese virus Corona/COVID-19 as an undetectable 'pandemic weapon' to spread over multiple countries and continents to ruin world's economy and killed millions of innocent unsuspecting people, says the statement. Teh VHP says that China has been casting its evil eyes towards Bharat in order to divert the world's attention from its deadly pandemic 'Corona crime'. ""Aksai Chin has been of Bharat and will ever remain, it is our determination"", says the VHP warning that people of Bharat will now give a befitting reply. The VHP Secretary General also said that humanity on earth is gnashing its teeth against  ""The Government of Bharat, to retaliate against the Dragon for the martyrdom of our brave soldiers, will have to adopt a stratagem to ensure retributive justice against wicked China globally to completely pound the Dragon's COVID-19 arrogant communist expansionist hood by exposing its grave crimes against humanity and humanism more extensively and intensively on the world stage, and countering and hitting back by a rock-response to the Dragon's brick-aggression"", says the VHP. VHP has also appealed to the people of Bharat to totally boycott Chinese goods and mobile apps so that the Dragon's backbone is entirely broken and made spineless. ""The rest, our capable national leadership, at the Centre and the well-geared, brave, seasoned soldiers, with great combat experience, at the borders, can tackle"", it says. In order to make India self-reliant, the VHP also urges Bharat's entrepreneurs and researchers  of the country to create quality goods that could obviate Chinese goods and render it out of place. Shri Parande also said that VHP Karyakartas have started their protests across the country in different ways against China's adventurism and will also expose the Dragon's misdeeds and conspiracies. The VHP and its youth wings (the Bajrang Dal and the Durga Vahini) will undertake door to door campaign across the country to make the people aware of China's sins so that the backbone of the wicked Dragon is broken, said the VHP's statement.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/18/Coronas-Father-China-will-have-to-be-crushed-completely-says-VHP-.html

A Medal for Corona Warriors, 22-Jun-2020,,"The war against Corona is no less than a war in defence of the Nation and for Internal Security. It is being fought valiantly by the Doctors, medical personnel,  support staff, police forces of the Centre and States, and many others. It is hightime that their efforts and sacrifices are recognised with a dedicated medal.  - B.L. Vohra It’s high time that the Government of India institutes a Medal for Corona Warriors. This war is no less than the wars that the Army/Defence Forces/Police forces/others fight in the defence of the Nation, for Internal Security etc. And it is being fought valiantly by the Doctors, all medical personnel, the support staff, police forces of the Centre and the States, and many others.  It’s easier to say that the Doctors are attending to the patients but being among the infected always and having the risk of being infected is very tough. Attending such duties for days together and going home after a few weeks and keeping themselves away from the family members, being insulted and beaten up sometimes by the patients and others, is a big courage and sacrifice.  Many of them have been infected and quite a few have laid down their lives in service to the society and the Nation. It is necessary to not only recognize their services, including supreme sacrifice made, but also to raise their morale and that of the Nation. Recognition of services is one of the methods shown by the States to show their gratitude and who will be more deserving than them in fighting this unknown virus these days which has suddenly descended on the globe leading to havoc with no end in sight at least in the near future. The following suggestions are made based on the templates and the experience already available. First, are the eligibility criteria.  All medical personnel including the support staff which has been involved in various stages of tackling this virus all over the country should be included along with police personnel of states and the Central Armed Police Forces, Defence Forces including Army, Navy and Air Force, Coast Guard,  people working in the Central and State Ministries and undertakings, the Administrators, private professionals involved in this work, the media personnel, the staff of the Railways, the Airlines, Embassies and Ministry of External Affairs, the scientists and the manufacturers of medicines and equipment, and other private players fighting this war in their own way. This list should be as broad based as possible and shouldn’t be confined to the government personnel only because there must be/and will be many unknown and unsung heroes. Second, the following categories of the Medal are suggested: (1) President’s Medal for Gallantry for the Corona Warrior in cases of supreme sacrifice of laying down the life in fighting the virus and for exceptional courage of a very high order. It should carry a citation and a cheque of Rs. Fifty lakhs in case of loss of life and Rupees Twenty lakhs to the living and be handed over by the President of India in a special function in Rashtrapati Bhawan at suitable intervals preferably once in six months. This function should be attended by the Vice President of India, the Prime Minister, other Ministers, leaders of opposition and other distinguished guests as also the family members of the awardee. This is the standard practice for giving other gallantry medals in the country.  (2) Indian Medal for Gallantry for the Corona Warrior in both cases of supreme sacrifice and exceptional courage of a little lesser category. This medal should carry a citation and a cheque of Rs. Fifty lakhs in case of supreme sacrifice (as loss of life should be treated at par monetarily with the higher medal as lives are equal) and Rs. Ten lakhs for the living awardee. This should be handed over by the Union Health Minister at a special function. (3) Medal for The Distinguished Service for Corona Warrior along with a citation to be handed over by the Governor/Lt. Governor  of the state/UT in which the awardee ordinarily resides, in a special function and  (4) Medal for Meritorious Service to be handed over in special function by the State Chief Minister/Head of the Department in a special function. All these special functions should be attended by the family members of the awardees and the guests. These functions should be telecast live by all the TV channels. Private channels should be persuaded to do the needful. A Committee should be appointed by the Central Government in the Union Health Ministry to decide the eligibility criteria, frame rules, to decide the format of recommendations, design medal, etc. A Committee should be appointed by the Central Government in the Union Health Ministry immediately with a time frame of one month to suggest the following: to decide the eligibility criteria, frame rules, to decide the format of recommendations, fix time-frame for receiving,  considering and deciding the recommendations, to design the medals, ribbons and the citations at the time of handing over of medals, deciding the logistics like the mint and the printing press for making the medals and printing the citations, to suggest the budgetary head from which the money will be spent in the Union Health Ministry, position of these medals in the Table of Precedence of Medals of the Government of India, the place on the clothes/uniforms where this medal will be worn and all other related matters.  Thereafter a branch in the Health Ministry should be earmarked to do this work on a regular basis. The templates for all this are available in the Home and Defence Ministries because they award and give medals on Republic Day and Independence Day each year. The first instalment of handing over these medals should be done within two months from now. It’s feasible provided the will is there and why it shouldn’t be there? The earlier the better to recognize the services and raise the morale. A quicker announcement about it by the Prime Minister will be very desirable. In addition to the medals, the insurance cover already announced for medical personnel should be extended to other categories of Corona warriors. Also in the case of loss of life, the family should get full pay being drawn by the deceased on the day of his death as pension till he would have attained the retirement age as is the case at present in the armed forces and police forces when they make the supreme sacrifice in a warlike situation. Also, one person in the family of the deceased should be given a permanent government job, according to his capability, in the central or state government on compassionate grounds as is done in central and state government presently in the case of death of the government officials on duty. This facility should also be extended to the next of kin of those warriors also who were not in government service at the time of their death, unless they don’t want it.   These are the rough contours of the suggested medal.  Of course, there can always be improvements in these suggestions because of different inputs from various angles and sources. But it should be done fast even if it turns out to be an imperfect model at present. The famous quote, justice delayed is justice denied, should be kept in mind. Suitable changes can always be made later on. This is not a favour that the country will be doing to the Corona warriors. It’s their due.

Over 2 lakh corona tests performed in a single day; COVID-19 recovery rate improves to 56.70 pct in country, 24-Jun-2020,,"In a significant ramping of the testing facilities across the country, more than 2 lakh samples/day were tested in the last 24 hours, the highest so far. With 2,15,195 samples tested yesterday, the total number of samples tested thus far is 73,52,911. While 1,71,587 samples were tested in Government labs, 43,608 were tested by private labs. Private labs have also reached the highest per day sampling with this quantity, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said today in a press release. As a testimony to the ever growing network of diagnostic labs for testing COVID-19, India now has 1000 labs across the country. This includes 730 in the government sector and 270 private labs. The break-up is as below: Real-Time RT PCR based testing labs: 557 (Govt: 359 + Private: 198) TrueNat based testing labs: 363 (Govt: 343 + Private: 20) CBNAAT based testing labs: 80 (Govt: 28 + Private: 52) The number of COVID-19 patients recovering very day is growing too. During the last 24 hours, a total of 10,495 COVID-19 patients have been cured. A total of 2,58,684 patients have been cured. The recovery rate is 56.71% amongst COVID-19 patients. Presently, there are 1,83,022 active cases and all are under active medical supervision. Meanwhile, the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has also recommended the use of rapid antigen test kits for diagnosis of COVID-19 in containment zones in combination with the RT-PCR test. The kits will allow faster diagnosis without laboratory examination. India is also producing high quality, low cost testing swabs which resulted in the production of millions of swabs in record time and at a fraction of the cost of the imported ones. However, in spite of these developments, access to testing still remains a huge challenge in a large country like India. ICMR has suggested to include additional testing methods to improve the access and availability of testing in various parts of the country.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/24/Over-2-lakh-corona-tests-performed-in-a-single-day.html
How RSS and its inspired organisations fought Congress imposed Emergency, 25-Jun-2020,- Vibhawari Bidve,"RSS defied the ban and thousands participated in Satyagraha against the ban and curtailment of fundamental rights. Volunteers of the RSS formed underground movements for the restoration of democracy.  (Image courtesy: MyIndiaGlory.com) Democracy and the resulting values like personal liberty and freedom of speech are considered as the achievement of freedom struggle we fought and the constitution we framed. But later, there were many occasions when we again saved the democratic values from arbitrary and dictatorial actions. Declaration of Emergency during 1975-77 was one of such dark periods that the Nation cannot forget. It was set in motion by the Indira Gandhi Government on 25th June 1975 and was in place until 21st March 1977 i.e. for 21 months. Officially ‘internal disturbance’ was the reason which was put forth. But it allowed elections to be suspended and civil liberties were curbed. Fundamental rights were suppressed, political arrests took place under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act and an atmosphere of fear prevailed. All the newspapers in the country were asked to take permission before publishing anything by the Press Advisor. All the opponents of Smt. Gandhi like the then Janata Party leader LK Advani, Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Madhukar Dattatraya Deoras, Arun Jetly, student leaders, social activists, journalists were arrested. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, organizing the protests against the Government, was also banned. Thousands of its workers were imprisoned. The RSS defied the ban and thousands participated in Satyagraha i.e. peaceful protests against the ban and the curtailment of fundamental rights. Later, when there was no letup, the volunteers of the RSS formed underground movements for the restoration of democracy. Literature that was censored in the media was published and distributed on a large scale and funds were collected for the movement. Networks were established between leaders of different political parties in the jail and outside for the co-ordination of the movement.  ‘The Economist’ described the movement as ""the only non-left revolutionary force in the world"". It said that the movement was ""dominated by tens of thousands of RSS cadres, though more and more young recruits are coming"". Talking about its objectives it said, ""its platform at the moment has only one plank: to bring democracy back to India"". Total 23,015 people were arrested under MISA and D.I.R. out of which 16,383 people were the Swayamsevaks and Karyakartas of RSS, Janasangh, Rashtriya Sevika Samiti, VHP, ABVP etc. 44965 people were arrested for fighting and agitating by way of Satyagraha out of which 35310 were from the above said right – wing organizations. Indeed, the democracy was saved and protected by raising the voice in such a dark period by these fighters. Finally, it ended on March 23, 1977. The MISA Act got repealed when Smt. Indira Gandhi lost the general election. Apart from the end result, it is noteworthy to see the women's participation in the said Satyagrahas. Whenever RSS is blamed for not having women Karyakartas, one overlooks that during such an ‘emergency’ women activists were seen to be participated along with Swayamsevaks. Many girls and women from the offshoots of RSS like ABVP, Rashtriya Sevika Samiti, VHP, etc. along with women leaders of Janasangha got arrested for Satyagraha as well as under MISA Act. A total number of 2424 women were arrested for holding Satyagraha and Maharashtra was leading in the number. I always find myself asking a question about the aftermaths of protests and agitations. Yells like ‘Hame Chahiye Ajadi’ and for Afzal Guru fade very soon. We neither see anything productive coming out from such screams. But how do the protestors thereafter pursue their fight?  I was doubtful till I got acquainted with Mrs. Anjali Parchure - Deshpande who was one of the detainees of Satyagraha against emergency.  Mrs. Anjali Deshpande was an active volunteer of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. ABVP was holding Satyagrahas in all the colleges in Pune so like all over the country. The other organizations also engaged in the same activities in every chouk and on every road. Anjalitai was the organizer of a girls batch who protested in Saint Meera’s College. She, along with the other student Satyagrahis got arrested as expected. Further they were tried and got 1 to 3 months imprisonment in Yerawada Jail, Pune. Surprisingly the jail was overflowing by approximately 250 women protestors; and the majority of them were from offshoots of RSS. Mrs. Anjali Deshpande recollects few names like Jaywantiben Mehta, Sumatibai Sukalikar along with Smt. Pramila Dandavate, Ahilya Rangnekar etc. She immerses in nostalgia with the memories of daily activities in jail. Despite being an organizer of Satyagraha, Mrs. Anjali Deshpande was not tried under MISA Act and was released after the imprisonment of 1month. Then came the more interesting part of the whole narration about which I was curious. After the successful activities, not only that volunteers of RSS kept on working for the organization, but many women too devoted their time to their respective organizations. The difference between the other and right-wing activism was now clear to me. Mrs. Anjali Deshpande herself became the 1st full-time women volunteer in India and worked for 4 years. She continued serving through ABVP, even after her marriage. Anjali Sarolkar Pathak who worked for Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram at Manipur and after marriage the couple continued the same work in Maharashtra.  Mrs. Sunita Puranik Godbole who was co-prisoner with Anjalitai now works for Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram in Jagdalpur, Bastar which is a Naxalite area. Anupama Limaye who also was a Satyagrahi with Anjalitai elected as a corporator in Pune and now runs an NGO – ‘Swamini’ for women empowerment. Jaywantiben Mehta was imprisoned for 19 months. She performed her active role in BJP. She was elected to the Maharashtra legislative assembly, then to Lok Sabha and served as a Minister of Power in the Vajpayee Govt. Smt. Sumatibai Suklikar too became a prominent leader of BJP. Many volunteers of Rashtriya Sevika Samiti and other organizations are still actively working for their organizations. Mrs. Anjali Deshpande with her fight for freedom of speech is now active in ‘Drishti’. Drishti works for collecting the information, documentation and research related to women’s issues in India. The right to information is an important right which helps to protect freedom of speech. Therefore she finds her work of compilation of information and its documentation very much important. Drishti has carried out some major researches throughout India. Research on the socio-economic status of women in India, research on tribal women from Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa migrating to big cities for working as house maidservants, research on declining female sex ratio in Hariyana are the few  pieces of research carried out by Drishti. It was an enriching and inspiring talk with Anjalitai. Participation of women volunteers along with RSS Swayamsevaks to re-establish and save the democratic principles was indeed very much important. And foremost important was the ‘constructive approach’, continuance, and perseverance of the right-wing Karyakartas in their work.

"Renowned script writers, journalists and critics decry increasing Hinduphobia and anti-Bharatiya content in Cinema and Web series", 02-Jul-2020,,"The participants of the webinar were unanimous in their opinion that the lobby which is creating content to hurt Hindu sentiments should be toppled and their plans to mislead and pollute our art and culture should not be allowed to succeed. Renowned story writers, script writers, journalists and critics were part of a webinar on 'Increasing Hinduphobia and anti-Bharatiya content in Cinema and Web series' organised by Bharatiya Chitra Sadhana and Vishwas Samvad Kendra on June 28 in New Delhi. Dilip Shukla (Story and Dialogue Writer), Anant Vijay (Associate Editor, Dainik Jagran), Film Critic and Journalist Vishnu Sharma were part of the webinar. Atul Gangwar (writer and director) moderated the discussion. Dilip Shukla who has written dialogues for Dabangg series, Damini, Ghayal, said that ""I have written in films like Damini, Ghayal. The aim was to make a good film and depict what is happening in our society. Dialogues are to convey a good topic. I did not write anything that is unethical in my films and also did not write any content which is not in the soceity or anything which people felt was misplaced. I will never write anything that will hurt our social and moral values."". He said that Web Series are created by producers who do not mind about any values. I do not support anything that is not in the benefit of the society, he said. He said that in inappropriate content are shown in web series and cinema. People should come forward with suggestions on how to prevent this and how to control the vulgarity in web series. This is also happening as those who write good stories and plot are not getting enough support and this is create financial problems for them. They are then forced to write for spicy web series which lack in values. Film critic and writer Vishnu Sharma said that, ""Web series does not only include vulgarity but pursue and agenda to target Indian values. Even a single dialogue can represent the confusion in the entire film but can have a huge impact on the common man. A dialogue in the web series 'Family Man' tries to convey that Tamil is older than Sanskrit and this falsity creates a confusion in the minds of people who watch. Indian ethos are targeted by naming characters and web series after Hindu gods and goddesses. They also hurt Hindu traditions knowingly. When the web series 'Krishna Lila' was opposed, those who support it asked why is it wrong when we we portray it when Krishna himself indulged in Leela. Curbing the spread of indecency and obscenity Dilip Shukla said that obscenity is shown intentionally. Those who indulge in obscenity should be boycotted so that they do not have the courage to commit such a mistake in the future. If a small series or producers try to portray a particular religion or sect in a wrong way, then action should be taken against them as those from these small banners can be easily stopped. However, it is difficult to stop people from big production houses who make movies like ""Kaala"" spending crores and feature mega stars. But we need to think on how to prevent these people from depicting anything wrong. He further said that a strategy should be made where the audience themselves stand up to objectionable content or call out a lobby that is conspiring to hurt Sanatan Hindu culture. These days, no film or web series depict a Muslim character in poor light. However, only Hindu characters are shown in a negative manner. This is completely intentional, he said. This has to be curbed and governments too have to take appropriate action. A monitoring mechanism for web series should be created which will screen the content. Legal remedies are also necessary to control bad content in web series. Anant Vijay, National Award Winner for Film Review and Associate Editor of Dainik Jagran, said that ""Despite necessary laws being already in place, such content is being created. Just as anti-National content cannot be shown under Section 1860 of IPC, web series can be regulated under Section 124. There are many laws in India, through which one can regulate the OTT content. Unlawful words, content, visuals, statements can be stopped under this law. Section 67 of Unlawful Activities Act applies to Web series too. Section 39 of this act prohibits objectionable spoken words and action. However, the biggest tool to curb them is the IT Act which prevents obscene and religiously hurtful content from being aired. Most speakers opined that a mechanism has to be created to monitor web series and for this thinkers, writers, journalists must come forward and make a policy. Writers and producers who create hurtful content must be monitored. They said that it is due to the absence of any kind of law regulating web series, scenes which are openly hateful and obscene are shown. Dirty and obscene content is served which is misleading our youth. Indian traditions are targeted in web series like Patalalok, where scenes and content that defame and tarnish Sanatan Hindu ethos and criminalize Hindu values ​​are shown. Not only this, our army and their families, which have served the nation are also portrayed in a derogatory manner. The participants were unanimous in their opinion to curb such web series and films that hurt Hindu culture. The lobby which is running the agenda to hurt Hindu sentiments, divide the society in the name of caste, religion and create hatred in the minds of people should be toppled. It is hightime that such content is stopped and their plans to mislead and pollute our art and culture should not be allowed to succeed they concluded.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/2/Script-writers-journalists-and-critics-decry-increasing-Hinduphobia-and-anti-Bharatiya-content-in-Cinema-and-Web-series.html

From sleeping in a bus stand unable to pay hostel fees to an award-winning Drone scientist - Inspiring story of Pratap in achieving against all odds, 05-Jul-2020,,"Pratap has built more than 600 drones from eWaste and has won medals for India in international competitions Pratap, all of 22, has achieved what many only dream of. Pratap won the 1st prize at a Drone competition in Japan. His accomplishments have been talk of the town and have inspired many youngsters to persevere and achieve their dreams. However, Pratap's path to present success has not been easy and was full of thorns. Humble beginnings Pratap is a native of Netkal village in Malavalli Taluk of Mandya district in Karnataka. He comes from a family of farmers. His father Marimaddaiah was a farmer too and mother Savita, a housewife. Earning a few thousand rupees a month was just enough to feed the family. However, Pratap was enamoured by eagles, helicopters, and other flying objects since his childhood. His inquisitiveness in flying objects created interest in science and electronics. He started to develop small robots and working models from waste materials while at school itself. He won several prizes in school with his science projects. While studying in Pre-university, he acquainted himself with various websites such as Aviation, Space, Rolls Royce cars, Boeing 777, etc. by browsing from a cyber cafe near his house. Though he wished to pursue engineering, his family could not afford the fees, and hence he opted to study BSc in Physics at JSS College, Mysore. Unable to pay hostel fees at the college, he was thrown out of the hostel. For a few days, he was forced to sleep at the Mysore Bus stand and had to wash his clothes in a public toilet. Such experiences did not deter Pratap, and he continued to learn computer languages such as C++, Java and Python on his own. He also learnt about creating Drones through eWaste, and this opened his path to success. Path to success While trying to create his first drone from eWaste, Pratap failed nearly 80 times. But he learnt a lot during his trials and was finally able to develop a drone that was good enough to participate in a contest. He took his drone to a Drone model competition at IIT Delhi. Pratap, who was literally in shabby clothes compared to the other competitors at IIT Delhi, focused on the competition instead. Here he won the 2nd prize after which the organisers urged him to participate in the world-renowned International Drone competition in Japan that was to be held November 27 to December 2, 2017. Going to Japan wasn't a straight forward path. In order to be eligible, his thesis on the drone he was to build had to be approved by as academic Professor at a  Chennai college. After gathering the necessary money, Pratap went to Chennai for the first time and with great difficulty was able to get the approval of the Professor. The next challenge was to find funds for his travel to Japan and the related arrangements. Hailing from a humble background, arranging Rs 60000 to go to Japan was a huge task. Luckily, a philanthropist from Mysore sponsored his flight ticket, but he needed more for the entire trip. The rest of the money was arranged by selling his mother's Mangala Sutra. After going through all this, he managed to reach Tokyo in his maiden flight to Japan all alone. When Pratap landed there, he had only Rs 1400 in his pocket. He could not afford the famous Bullet Trains in Japan. He then decided to carry his luggage along with his drone, which together weighed around 360 Kgs in a regular train by paying the extra amount. Some distance he covered by walk to save money as even taxi/cabs were costly. His mother's Mangala Sutra finally enabled him to reach the destination where the competition was to take place. He participated in the Drone competition where participants from 127 nations were present. Pratap showcased and flew his drone, which he called 'Eagle' and mesmerised the audience. However, after the competition, as the results were being announced, there was no mention of his name until the very last. As the top three names were to be announced, Pratap was dejected and started walking back, thinking that he had lost. The judges announced the third prize, then the second and finally the first prize was announced. ""Please welcome Mr Pratap, Gold Medalist from India"", said the judges and Pratap's joy knew no bounds.  Pratap NM along with one of his drones (Image: Edex Live) Pratap's Gold medal at the Drone competition saw Indian tricolour fly above that of USA and Japan. He was rewarded with $10000 as the prize money. His victory at the competition was the beginning of the accolades he was to receive. Coming to know of his struggle and accomplishments, Japanese Nobel laureate Hideki Shirakawa invited him to his home. It was an experience that Pratap cherishes very much. He was congratulated by MLA's and MP's of Karnataka. In the subsequent days, Pratap participated in competitions in other countries. He won the 'Albert Einstein's Innovation Medal' at the 2018 International Exhibition in Germany. However, once when he was in France, he ran out of money and had no money left for the return flight to India. During his stay, his achievements were recognised by France and his photo had appeared in a local newspaper. The airport staff recognised him, and despite not knowing him in person, they gave him a special treat and booked a seat for him on a business class flight. In service of Motherland Achievements of Pratap have been recognised in several countries like Japan, Germany and France. In each of these countries and elsewhere, he has received offers from government agencies and companies which have offered him millions of rupees, houses and huge perks. But Pratap is very clear that he wishes to work for his Motherland. Former President APJ Abdul Kalam has always inspired Pratap. He says that he grew watching and reading him. It is Kalam who inspired him to work for the nation, says Pratap. The drone developed by Pratap is a technological breakthrough in India. His drone, named 'Eagle', has the technology to detect people at the border instantly. It can be used to ascertain if they are intruders or anyone in danger. He is also working on drones that will benefit the farmers in planning for crops, soil quality, and other parameters.  (Disclaimer: The story has been sourced from various news items and articles.

Thanks to the determination of the villagers, liquor is completely prohibited in the village. The notice of prohibition has been implemented in the villagers out of their own will and this was possible with the help of local police. It was during the time of national lockdown that all the alcohol shops were closed. However, gradually as total lockdown was lifted, Karnataka too decided to open its liquor shops in the state in early May. Andhra continued with its prohibition of liquor even after lockdown was lifted. Due to this, people from Andhra came to Kodigehalli to buy liquor as it is closer to the border between the two states. Understanding the dynamics of Covid19, the spread from other states and also being conscious of the health of the residents, the villagers voluntarily shut down all the shops in the village selling liquor.

India takes strong exception to China’s attempt to initiate a discussion on J&K in UNSC, 07-Aug-2020,,"New Delhi, 06 Aug: Amid the prolonged Sino-India military stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), India has taken strong exception to China’s attempt to initiate a discussion in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on issues pertaining to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir. India has firmly rejected China’s interference in its internal affairs and urged it to draw proper conclusions from such infructuous attempts. Anurag Srivastava, spokesperson, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) today said in a statement that ‘‘we have noted that China initiated a discussion in the UN Security Council on issues pertaining to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir. This was not the first time that China has sought to raise a subject that is solely an internal matter of India. As on such previous occasions, this attempt too met with little support from the international community. We firmly reject China’s interference in our internal affairs and urge it to draw proper conclusions from such infructuous attempts.’’ In response to a media query on Chinese MFA spokesperson’s comment on Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Srivastava had said yesterday that ‘‘we have noted the comments of the Chinese MFA spokesperson on the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The Chinese side has no locus standi whatsoever on this matter and is advised not to comment on the internal affairs of other nations.’’ Swatantra Dev Singh, Uttar Pradesh BJP state president said, ‘‘One year ago on the 5th of August 2019, the Parliament of India took the historic decision to reorganise the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir into the two new Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir. With the support of an overwhelming majority in both the Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament, representing the will of over a billion Indian citizens, a landmark law was passed repealing the temporary but discriminatory provisions in the Constitution of India, thereby making Kashmir a truly integral and inalienable part of India.’’ ‘‘China has been acting as ‘Begaani shaadi me Abdullah deewana’. It has no right in interfering in India’s internal matters. A year on, our government has made every concerted effort to bring the people of Kashmir into the mainstream by promoting socio-economic development that was denied to them for over seven long decades. The positive changes during the past year in the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir are evident for all to see,’’ Singh added.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/7/India-takes-strong-exception-to-China-attempt-to-discuss-J-K-in-UNSC.html

"Guru Purnima: History, myth or fiction?", 09-Jul-2020,,"Keeping our sanity intact is responsibility that guru accepts. And, responsibility fructifies in love. That is why love is seen as synonymous with wisdom and guru as an embodiment of love.  - Nandkishore Tiwari Guru Purnima is celebrated among Hindus, Buddhists and Jains same day. Sharing same festival across religions is evidence of our timeless fundamental spiritual unity and also living evidence of strength of Indian spiritual traditions. Guru Purnima is also known as Vyas Purnima because Bhagwan Veda Vyas was born on this day. Tirthankara Vardhamana Mahavira made his first disciple this day. Tathagata Buddha gave his first sermon on this day so it is celebrated as Buddha Purnima. Inclusivity defines our very temperament while, cleverness ( Vichakshata) and gratefulness stirred by inspiration is seen as virtuousness of character which in turn leads to gratitude and wisdom journeying through knowledge, devotion and liberation.  While, Cunningness ( prapanch) stirred by instinct of usurping and claiming lands us in slippery slope of ingratitude and egoism. Unlike LAC, Line differentiating cunningness from cleverness is very thin and invisible. Keeping our sanity intact is responsibility that guru accepts. And, responsibility fructifies in love. That is why love is seen as synonymous with wisdom and, guru as an embodiment of love. If we consider ourselves medium of wisdom then Knowledge and devotion would be termed as means to attract divine grace, compassion and liberation. Guru Purnima is remembrance and celebration of this crystallised opportunity which is bestowed on us for evolving and transforming into becoming gratefulness. Guru Purnima is woven around life of great seer Veda Vyasa because not only his birth but few other auspicious happenings like his beginning of writing or dictating Mahabharata also happen to fall on this this day. His life is full with super natural happenings beginning right from his birth. His father sage Parashar was astrologer and astronomer and knew auspicious time for everything, so while going in a boat rowed by sailor Dasraj”s daughter Matasyagandha (Satyavati), Parashara saw that if a child is conceived within these 48 minutes (known as muhurta) that child will be genius par excellence. So he proposed to Matsyagandha for intercourse and matsya gandha agreed to his proposal on certain conditions, which Parashara fulfilled and Veda Vyas was born. Since, he was born as a dark skinned and on island hence the name Krishna Dwaipayana. When he expressed his wish to go for penance, his mother pleaded against it and remonstrated. Endowed with his supernatural powers he gave her word that whenever she needed him, then just by thinking of him he will immediately arrive and do her bidding. And, he kept his word till his mother lived. Considering guru higher than god and, accord higher place to woman as compared to man are two basic values that Indian spiritual traditions uphold. Veda Vyas lived those values all through his life and became synonymous with word guru. On this Guru Purnima let us contemplate over our spiritual traditions whether these are very breath of our eternal life or mere ornamental embellishments to boast of glorious past? As, it’s always better to question and accept everything on value, be it in the field of science or that of religion. Spirituality (wisdom) is mother of all branches of knowledge (sciences) looking for truth. And, Satyam Param Dheemahi (Truth is ultimate wisdom and vice versa) is the assertion of spirituality. It is important to remember all stories related to all our festivals as, this exercise keeps us rooted in cultural values. If, we don’t then, our glorious history, traditions and collective memories are reduced to rituals and, finally get dumped into genre of myth. We uphold values only, when we know those values to be real. If we reduce our history to mere story or myth then neither celebrating nor donning those values by the characters in those stories would inspire awe and wonder in our attitude towards our glorious history and we will not feel meaning in upholding them as eternal spiritual values. And, it is loss of spiritual values in society that breeds all kinds of individual inferiorities and social evils like drug addiction, physical violence, and mental cruelty to name a few. And, all this leads to poverty which is termed as ultimate misery. The society which doesn’t preserve spiritual prosperity can’t sustain its material prosperity for long. Therefore, character building is key component in overall well-being of human race and, festivals prove helpful in character building of our children. Veda Vyas and Guru Purnima itself is one such example. Vyasa’s spiritual eloquence is eternal. Fruits of his timeless Purusarth in the form of Vedas, Mahabharata, Puranas etc is before us enriching our lives. Despite such glowing evidences before our eyes should we consider him a fictional figure? We have numerous festivals and a galaxy of great beings related to those festivals they are our ancestors. Their attainments and achievements are so grand that all earthlings across nations may feel affinity towards them and perceive them as their own ancestors. And, rightly so because the vision of seers has unexceptionally been that of universal welfare. Sarve Bhavantu sukhinah and Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam are not political slogans but our spiritual yardsticks from the very beginning of time. Ironically, we prefer to send our children to attend motivation classes for inspiration and leadership, where motivational speakers ferret out exotic sounding names other than that of our own great seers and saints. Don’t as parents we know that by doing this we are putting the seed of inferiority and lie in innocent minds and hearts. It is no body’s case here that we should become confined to past or victims of past and exclude teaching our kids (and more so to adults) the achievements of all those who are not born in India. Quite the contrary, point being made here is that we should put the things in right order. When will we see our own treasure and value it? The treasure which is lying buried within all of us in one sense or the other. If we ourselves are not valuing our truth who else will value and trust us? If we ourselves begins to see our history as mythology and fiction, then who should we blame for our down fall from place of being world leader in matters of directing destiny of humanity and planet earth (Bhu-Devi)!  Is it our incapacity or that of our ancestors that we are incapable of transcending our mind and experience the supernatural as they did? There is very thin line between pursuing supernatural and becoming superstitious. One leads to waking us up to our potential and seeing wonder that as consciousness we ourselves are and, another misleads to miracle mania and brain washing. On this Guru Purnima let us meditate and choose (satya sankalp) to enlighten our daily behaviour with light of clarity, correctness and purity leaving behind doubt, fear and corruption.

Stories of Bharat - Seva Bharati builds a bamboo bridge in a Kerala village to connect to the outside world during rainy season, 10-Jul-2020,,"Volunteers of Seva Bharati constructing the temporary bamboo bridge on the outskirts of Moolamattom in Kerala The villagers near Moolamattom in Kerala are faced with a unique problem every year. The village is situated in Arappuzhalam panchayat in Idukki district of Kerala is surrounded by forests all around. Every year during the rainy season the water level raises and consequently the area around the village become difficult to tread, especially for the aged and the children. The village is practically cut-off from the outside world. This year too as continuous rains lashed the region, several houses on the outskirts of Moolamattom were cutoff from the outside world. The area being a forested one with rocky terrain, it also becomes slippery and dangerous to walk. For several months, buying necessary goods and other essentials would become difficult for many living on the outskirts. Many like Sunny are cut off from their families who has constructed a small house on the outskirts of the village. He stays with his aged mother, wife and three children but during rainy season they were unable to travel to the nearby town of Moolamattom to buy necessary items. He was also unable to go to his work place in the town during rainy season as they were cut-off. Volunteers of Seva Bharati came to know about their difficulty they faced during the rainy season. A Seva Bharati team visited the village and arranged for the necessary materials to build a temporary bamboo bridge. The volunteers built the bamboo bridge which enables those on the outskirts to walk to the nearest town. Every year, people like Sunny were forced to commute to the nearest town only after the rains stopped and the water levels subsided.  However this year due to the efforts of the volunteers of Seva Bhratai, many like Sunny have a bridge on which they can commute and buy essential items from Moolamattom. Thanks to the bridge, Sunny can now go to the town to his workplace too. The service of the volunteers of Seva Bharati has been acknowledged and appreciated by the people of Moolamattom and the surrounding villagers.

"Pooja, Arati and Darshan of Shri Amarnath Ji to be telecast live on Doordarshan; Devotees request similar arrangements for Shri Budha Amarnath Ji shrine in Poonch", 17-Jul-2020,- Ronik Sharma,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Jammu and Kashmir administration has decided to put several restrictions and regulations on the pilgrimage this year. Every year from June to August lakhs of pilgrims from different parts of the country visit and  pay their obeisance to Holy Shrines of Shri Amarnath Ji in Kashmir and Shri Budha Amarnath Ji in Poonch. In the prevailing situation, with the cases of COVID-19 increasing day by day, the Jammu and Kashmir Union Territory administration has taken various steps to stop the spread. Accordingly, the Union territory Administration in consultation with Shri Amarnath Ji Shrine board has decided to allow only 500 pilgrims per day by road to reach the holy cave of Amarnath Ji this year. They are also mandated to follow all the regulations as per the SOPs issued by the Administration. Every year, thousands of devotees from across the country visit Shri Budha Amarnath ji to pay their obeisance at the holy Shrine Situated at Village Mandi in district Poonch. The Shri Budha Amarnath Ji Yatra is organised by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang dal during the period of Raksha Bandhan every year. Taking the prevailing situation into consideration and for the first time ever, the Aarti at Amarnath Ji's cave shrine will be streamed live for the benefit of millions of devotees across the country and the world. The special arrangements have been made by Shri Amarnath Ji Shrine Board and the Union Territory administration for the first time. Aarti, Poojan and darshan of the Natural Shiv ling will be telecast live from 8 am to 10 am  on DD Bharti and will continue from 5:30 pm to 6 pm on Doordarshan National. Devotees request similar arrangements for Shri Budha Amarnath Ji shrine However, the Union Territory Administration has not taken any decision over the annual pilgrimage of Shri Budha Amarnath Ji and Chhari Yatra which are supposed to happen two days before Raksha Bandhan every year. The annual pilgrimage of the Shri Budha Amarnath ji starts in the last week of July or first week of the August every year till the Raksha Bandhan. The Raksha Bandhan ‘Chhari yatra’ leaves from Dashnami Akhara in Poonch town to the holy place of the Shri Budha Amarnath ji every year two days before the Raksha Bandha day. Last year, due to Security reasons the annual pilgrimage of Shri Budha Amarnath Ji was canceled and Chhari Yatra was also limited due to restrictions enforced by the district administration. It is pertinent to mention here that thousands of pilgrims from different parts of the Jammu and Kashmir and all over India visit Shri Budha Amarnath Ji Shrine during the holy month of Shrawan to celebrate the auspicious festival of Raksha Bandhan. However, this year due to the restrictions over movement all across the Country due Corona pandemic, devotees may not be able to reach the Shri Budha Amarnath Ji Shrine. Hence, devotees are urging the Union Territory Administration to hold consultations with District Administration of Poonch, the heads of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Dashnami Akahada Committee, Budha Amarnath Mandir Committe and Mahant Dashnami Akahada Poonch Shri Shri 1008 Rajguru Mahamandleshwar Swami Vishwatma Nand Saraswati Ji Maharaj, and make similar arrangments like that of Shri Amarnath Ji Yatra in Kashmir for the Shri Budha Amarnath Ji Shrine located at Rajpura in Mandi of Poonch district. Administration can ensure limited presence of devotees who are interested to come for this holy pilgrimage at Shri Budha Amarnath Ji Shrine and pay their respects. Special transportation facilities can be arranged by following the guidelines and the SOPs laid down by the Administration. The Poonch District administration and particularly the department of information and broadcasting may be directed to arrange for the live telecast of the Poojan, Aarati and Darshan from the sacred Shri Budha Amarnath Ji Shrine everyday in the morning and evening. Millions of devotees all over the country as well as elsewhere in the world are sentimentally attached to the holy Shrine of Budha Amarnath Ji. Lieutenant Governor is further appealed to facilitate necessary arrangements for the Chhari yatra which is to take place two days prior to Shrawan Purnima i.e Raksha Bandhan. In view of the pandemic and prevailing situation District administration of Poonch should also make necessary arrangements for live telecast of Chhari Mubarak and Sharwan Purnima festival from Budha Amarnath temple in Mandi. Security related arrangments coupled with necessary facilities may also be provided to the pilgrims who will be coming from far off places all across India. Deputy Commissioner of Poonch should also provide and install sanitization tunnels at Dashnami Akahada Poonch and Shri Budha Amarnath Ji Shrine. A Health Care system for Pilgrims with immunity boosting medicines, disinfectants, masks, sanitizers should also be ensured for making this Yatra safe for everyone.

RSS and its resolve to make the motherland prosper, 20-Jul-2020,- Prabhat Jha,"For the RSS, it is all about the responsibility and not the position. The volunteers consider the suffering of the nation as theirs' own. Whether it was the Emergency period or now during the Corona pandemic, Swayamsevaks of the RSS have only one goal in mind, which is to sacrifice themselves for the cause of Bharat Mata.             Recently, Dr. Mohan Bhagwat ji, the chief (Sarsanghchalak) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS), while presenting his views on the topic 'Current Scenario and our Role', said that ‘The whole world is struggling with the pandemic Corona, yet life is going on. Volunteers (Swayamsevaks) may think that the daily gatherings of swayamsevaks (Shakhas) are closed and also the regular programs are not being carried out. It's not like this. The shakhas are also being organised and the works of the RSS are too going on. Just the appearances have changed’. Analysts and some of my political friends from the opposition parties are stunned by the views of Dr. Mohan Bhagwat ji, as what is so in the RSS that this organization remains unharmed under any circumstances? Even in this Corona period, the RSS is dynamic through new dimensions of activism.             The RSS is the only organization in the world which has been growing day by day since its inception. But, it is unfortunate that some people continue to tarnish its image. In this article I have presented the truth, what the RSS is all about. Although I am neither a spokesperson of the RSS nor an official, but I have been associated with the organisation ever since my childhood. So, as an ordinary volunteer, I am sharing my experience on this feature.            As a society based cultural organisation the RSS is known worldwide due to its unique methodology of organisational set up and functioning. It is such an organization of the world, constantly developing. It was banned thrice by the three Prime Ministers namely Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Narasimha Rao, but never stopped, tilted or tired, instead inverted with the support of the society.                 People wonder how the RSS is constantly engaged in its work. Perhaps they do not know that all the volunteers of the organisation work as a volunteer of the nation. They all have the same sentiment of 'selfless spirit'. Hence, clash does not take birth. The volunteers of the RSS grow with the spirit of ‘Tera Tujhko Arpan Kya Lage Mera' (what is yours’ I offer to you, nothing is mine). In the present materialistic era, instead of thinking about profit and loss, the volunteers of RSS continue to work selflessly. There is clarity that ‘the country gives us everything, even we should learn to give something'.              When the first Shakha was started in Nagpur on the day of Vijayadashami in 1925, the volunteers present pleaded the founder and the first chief of the RSS, Dr. Keshav Baliram Hedgewar ji to become the Guru. Dr. Hedgewar ji disapproving the idea stated that the Guru would be the holy saffron. The message went from there that the RSS would become a strong cultural organization in the service of the motherland working not based on the ideology and not an individual mind, with mission of hoisting the flag of Hindu culture in the world.              Seeing the growing spiritual and moral influence of the RSS across the country and also the birth of the Jana Sangh in Indian politics, the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru tried to discredit and end the organisation. Before that, the way the volunteers were tortured by making false accusations in the Gandhi assassination case, even today makes the story stand up. The then RSS chief Dr. Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar ""Guruji"", the worlds one of the best spiritual men was sent to the prison and the organisation was banned during the period of torture. However, the truth prevailed. The court gave verdict stating that the RSS and the volunteers of the organisation had nothing to do with the Gandhi assassination. The then people in power and the Congress had to face it with the head down. I remember, in an interview, senior Congress leader Vasant Sathe told me 'I don't understand why people oppose the RSS. I told Indira ji during the emergency, but she did not listen to anyone'.                   Despite all the odds, work of the RSS goes on continuously. The organisation has a clear belief that it will set up a Shakha everywhere and its volunteers will work in every direction and every place of the society. The best thing is that the RSS does not consider anyone its rival. Even Dr. Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar ‘Guruji’ used to say that the RSS considers that our today's opponent will be the supporter of tomorrow. We have to work in this wisdom. The RSS works putting in the centre culture and spirit of the national flag.             Educating the countrymen about patriotism and making them cultured is the dictum of the RSS. Millions of children across the country study through the Saraswati Shishu Mandir under the guidance of Vidya Bharati, inspired by the RSS. Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad for young students, Vishwa Hindu Parishad for the protection and preservation of the country's Hindu Sanatana Dharma , establishment of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh to work among labourers, employees, among teachers. All these organizations are in activism working with the inspiration of the RSS, yet they work with their mission, vision and plan. The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh  works among farmers, Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram works among tribal, Sanskar Bharti, Seva Bharti, Laghu Udyog Bharti, Krida Bharti, Arogya Bharti, Sanskrit Bharti, Pragya Bharti, Vigyan Bharti, Bharat Vikas Parishad.  Apart from these, several institutions such as National Editor's Council, Swadeshi Jagran Manch, Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh, Akhil Bharatiya Shikshan Mandal are working in different sections of the society today.          Bharat Prakashan, Vishwa Samvad Kendra, Deendayal Shodh Sansthan, Akhil Bharatiya Itihas Sankalan Samiti, Bharatiya Vichaar Kendra, Rashtriya Sikh Sangat, Vivekananda Kendra, Akhil Bharatiya Rashtriya Shaikshnik Parishad, Sahkar Bharati, Grahak Panchayat, Samajik Samrasta Manch , Hindu Jagran Manch, Akhil Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad, Paryvaran Samiti, Dadhichi Dehdaan Samiti are running in their respective fields of work with the inspiration of the RSS.           No one can understand the RSS sitting from a distance. Just as people do politics by ear and get cheated, in the same way, the RSS can be understood only by looking from the near. One can only be surprised knowing the organisation closely. Father of the Nation Bapu, Binova Bhave, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan, and if we talk about now, Bharat Ratna Dr. Pranab Mukherjee also changed his mind when he saw the RSS closely.    For the RSS, it is all about the responsibility and not the position. Every worker is unavoidable. Not only this, the opinion can be many but the decision is one. Detailed discussion before the final decision, however, once decision is taken only the execution. Today is the crisis of pandemic Corona. During the Emergency, thousands of the RSS volunteers were jailed. Inhumane tortures and atrocities were carried out on the volunteers and their families. Late Dinanath Mishra reflects the RSS's role in the second battle of India's democracy during the Emergency called 'Gupt Kranti'. It is clear from the book that not only the volunteers but their entire family are engaged and devoted to the service of the RSS.           The most endearing as regards the foundation of the RSS working is mutual credibility, intimacy and humanity. The volunteers consider the suffering of the nation as theirs' own. Equally, the sufferings of the volunteers are considered as the sufferings of their own family and do everything to overcome the. The RSS teaches to its people to learn giving.         Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the first volunteer who became the Prime Minister of the country and LK Advani the Deputy Prime Minister. The RSS volunteers in the country today are the President of India and the Vice President of India. They were pracharaks of the organisation. The former  pracharak Narendra Modi is today the Prime Minister himself. All together, a former pracharak Om Birla is the Lok Sabha Speaker. Besides, several ministers in the Union Cabinet , chief ministers of several states and also governors of many states were pracharaks or volunteers of the RSS formerly. The organisation must surely like it all, but it still considers itself a society based organization.       The RSS is not a root conscious organization. All the subsidiary organizations are the number one organization in the country in the present day. The work of the RSS is as well on a global scale. Shakha is organised in several nations of the world. Even the Rashtriya Sevika Samiti is the largest women's organization representing half the population of the country.        Volunteers are the backbone of the RSS, and runs with the support of the 'Gurudakshina' by them. The organisation has a wonderful pracharak system. Thousands of RSS pracharaks work all over the country have dedicated their own life in the service of the nation. The strongest moral foundation of the work is the pracharak system. Being simple and common, and with morality, authenticity and sensitivity, pracharaks instinctively perform the act of bonding with the spirit of humanity. They are the people at mission tasked to expanding the wings of the RSS. Without caring about themselves, they are in mission mood day and night making the motherland prosper and proud.       Even today during the current corona pandemic led crisis, the work of RSS is going on in full swing. Volunteers are praying for Rashtra Vandana organising sakhas in their respective offices or in the family. The service that the RSS volunteers have done in every state and district of the country during the lock-down without publicity is commendable. The governments in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka shocked the way RSS volunteers served food, food grains to the needy.  Human service is the mainstay of the RSS work. In the lockdown period the entire country has seen this with their open eyes.          Providing food and lodging to the needy, collecting food items from the society and making them available to them. These forms of public service are being done by all the subsidiary organizations of the RSS. However, the organisation keeps itself away from publicity. The volunteers of the organisation consider these services as their national duty. Seminars in several places, debate of the RSS thinkers, discussions through audio-video conferencing are going on all over India. All ancillary organizations have started work in their respective fields. The unique thing about the RSS is that it invites novelty and honours antiquity.            The shakha is the basis of activities of the RSS. Shakhas are also located in remote places of the country. Creating true people in the service of nation and humanity is accomplished through shakhas  in millions of places. This is the reason that wherever disasters occur in the country, the volunteers of the RSS arrive first and engage in relief work.             The RSS never says that it will alone make India glorious, but will play a major role in making so. If one wishes to understand the organisation, one has to see it with his/her own eyes. The organisation is the true bearer of the great cultural legacy of the country. Everyone has to come in the lap of this making, if not today.          The RSS has been working for a long time on public issues such as Article 370, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi movement, Common Civil Code. Happily, today there is a government of national ideology in the country. These resolutions of the RSS are coming true without any uproar.                 The RSS is the cultural and eternal soul of India. The organisation is all about Vande Mataram. the RSS is a spiritual and cultural ritual. In this sacrificial work, one who gives sacrifice is blessed. The RSS is neither an option nor is there any alternative to the organisation. It is an unwavering resolve of millions of volunteers to make the motherland prosper with pride.

Jagdeoram Uraon - A life in service on Vanavasis and Bharat Mata, 20-Jul-2020,- Jagdamba Mall,"After demise of Poojya Deshpande ji on 21st April 1995, Jagdeoram ji took over as National President. During his tenure, Kalyan Ashram touched from height to height. Number of full-time workers increased. There have been a complete cohesion, coordination and mutual understanding at all level in the organisation. Jagdeoram Uraon, 72, National President of Akhil Bhartiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram, breathed his last on 15th July 2020 at 3 PM after the lunch at its Jashpur Kendra due to massive cardiac arrest. He was under treatment of complaints of heart, lung and kidney. He was immediately rushed to hospital where doctors declared him as dead. Shri Jagdeoram Uraon was born on 9th October 1949 in Kongaro village, 3 KM from Jashpur to his father Akhanuram and mother Pooju Bai. He was 3 brothers and 2 sisters. He was RSS swayamsewak from his childhood days attending his village shakha. He was also attached to Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram from his childhood days as a student in Kalyan Ashram Chhatrawas. He passed matric education in 1966 from Government High School Jashpur while living in Kalyan Ashram Chhatrawas. He completed one year Physical Training Instructor (PTI) education from Tatya Tope Games & Sports College Shivpuri Madhya Pradesh and became PTI in Kalyan Ashram sponsored Swami Vivekanand Mahavidyalay Jashpur. While in Mahavidyalay, he was engrossed in the activities of RSS and Kalyan Ashram also. Simultaneously, he completed his post graduate degree as private candidate in political science. He belonged to a poor family and his parents were not academically literate but very intelligent and industrious. Traditional and un-advanced way of farming was the only source of earning to sustain the family. They had deep devotion in Sarana Dharma and Sarahul pooja. Jagdeoram ji inherited these virtues from his parents. While in Kalyan Ashram Chhatrawas at Jashpur from class 6th onwards since 1962, he was a regular swayamsewak of shakha held in Kalyan Ashram premises where he played Kho, Po, Tarr and Kabaddi with Balasahab Deshpande ji along with the fellow swayamsewaks. He was deeply influenced by the magnetic personality of Deshpande ji. His Kongaro village was surrounded and over-shadowed by thick forests with rich bio-diversity including deers, woodpeckers and wild boars etc. Jagdeoram ji grew up while playing with these animals – domestic, semi-domestic and semi-wild, unaware of outside world. His eyes got opened when in contact with Kalyan Ashram. His association with Deshpande ji was as if Narendra met Ramakrishna Paramhansh. He read books on great personalities of the country. Sangh Shiksha While in village, he attended RSS Shakha conducted by Shankar Rao Kane (Bhaiya Kane), Luthu Singh and Sharad Kale. He did 1st year OTC in 1966 in Bilaspur, 2nd year OTC in 1967 in Katni and 3rd year OTC in 1968 in Nagpur. Thereafter, he was a regular Sangh Shikshak in every OTCs held each year in Madhya Pradesh and Mahakoshal. He became Jashpur Tehsil Shareerik Pramukh of RSS during those days. Dharma Shiksha Varg 1965 A Dharma Shiksha Varg was organised in 1965 in the Ashram of Gahira Guruji at Raat Gufa (Kailash Gufa) for 15 days and Jagdeoram ji attended this dharmic training shivir. He had opportunity to meet and listen to what Gahira Guruji preached. On concluding day, a Sanskrit Mahavidyalay was inaugurated by Laren Soy. In Kalyan Ashram Ten year after its foundation, Jagdeoram ji came in close contact of Kalyan Ashram in 1962 when he came in its Jashpur Chhatrawas to study in class 6 in Government School. From 1962 to 1978, he was an active worker of Kalyan Ashram – first as student, then as teacher and games teacher (PTI). During national emergency in 1975-77, he was very active and finally landed in jail. During these turbulent days, his patriotism got boosted and he decided to become full-time worker in Kalyan Ashram. He discussed with Deshpande ji. Finally, he became full-time worker in April 1978 after getting relieved from school. Until this, the senior workers/adhikaris like Moru Bhaiya Ketkar ji (Bagicha waale Guruji), Dr. Prasanna Sapre ji, Krishna Rao Sapre ji and Mishrilal Tiwari ji etc. were RSS pracharaks. The concept of full-time worker was taking shape. Jagdeoram ji became 1st full-time worker of Kalyan Ashram and revealed the path. I had been attending national and regional meetings/conferences of Kalyan Ashram from August 1978 and I travelled from Nagaland. There were threadbare prolonged discussions on who could be full-time worker of Kalyan Ashram, what were its similarities and differences from RSS pracharak. Jagdeoram ji began touring with Balasahab Deshpande ji throughout the country as his sahayak (assistant). He was elevated to National Vice President in 1987 and to Working President in 1993 during Rashtriya Karyakarta Sammelan at Cuttack. During these days, he was under close watch of Deshpande ji who sculpted the person into what Jagdeoram ji was. In National Emergency 1975-77 Before clamping of National Emergency on 25th June 1975, he was games teacher (PTI) in Kalyan ashram sponsored Swami Vivekanand Mahavidyalay Jashpur. During emergency from 25th June 1975 to 21st March 1977, Balasahab Deshpande ji, Moru Bhaiya, Mishrilal ji, Ramlal and Swami Amaranand ji were arrested along with other workers and RSS karyakartas in the very beginning and put into Jashpur jail. Jagdeoram ji was spared on the ground that he was a janjati person. As planned, Dr. Prasanna Sapre went hiding. The School, Chhatrawas, Medical Clinic and whole Kalyan Ashram Campus was sealed and taken over by police. Jagdeoram ji dared to stay back in same campus and secretly kept meeting the family members of arrested adhikaris and karyakartas of RSS and Kalyan Ashram. After more than a year from imposition of emergency, a warrant of arrest was issued against him. He was secretly advised by police to leave the campus and go to his village to avoid police arrest. But he did not respond to what he was advised. He preferred to remain in the campus and continued working as before. Lastly, he was also arrested in October 1976 and put in Jashpur jail. After 10 days, he was sent to Raigarh jail, thereafter, till the end of emergency. Thus, he too, tasted the torture in confinement for nearly half a year. When emergency was over During emergency, the school, Chhatrawas, hospital and whole campus were purposely destroyed; Mahavidyalay was closed to avoid the continuance of teachers of hostile background. Jagdeoram ji was inducted in Middle School to help in re-establishing and rejuvenating it. But he preferred to work as full-time worker of Kalyan Ashram and thus he was brought back from school and inducted in Sangathan as 1st full-time worker of Kalyan Ashram in April 1978. He was very instrumental in vyavastha of 1st National Karyakarta Sammelan in August 1978 at Jashpur wherein Param Poojya Sarsanghchalak Balasahab Deoras was present for all the three days. The author of these lines also attended conference coming all the way from Nagaland. National Vice-President and Working President Kalyan Ashram became Akhil Bhartiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram after August 1978 conference. Jagdeoram ji began touring with Balasahab Deshpande ji throughout the country as his sahayak (assistant). He was elevated to National Vice President in 1987 and to Working President in 1993 during Rashtriya Karyakarta Sammelan at Cuttack. During these days, he was under close watch of Deshpande ji who sculpted the person into what Jagdeoram ji was. Into the reply of one of my questions during the prolonged interview, Jagdeoram ji said, “During journey with Poojyaniya Deshpande ji after taking over as the personal assistant in 1978, I had an opportunity of meeting and conversing with various State Organising Secretaries and senior karyakartas, I was much impressed to witness in them the wisdom, scholarship, commitment, clarity in thought and action, simplicity, honesty and hard work. The organisational skill was tremendous and amazing; also amusing free from ego. In this context, the combative spirit of some of early karyakartas like Gunwant Singh Kothari, Kripa Prasad Singh, Anil Holsamudra, Balram Malviya, Nishikant Joshi, Smt. Aruna Holsamudra, Smt. Madhavi Joshi etc. was stunning, impressive and inspiring. I learnt much from them also. Further, I was highly inspired by Rani Gaidinliu and N.C. Zeliang of Nagaland.” National President After demise of Poojya Deshpande ji on 21st April 1995, Jagdeoram ji took over as National President. During his tenure, Kalyan Ashram touched from height to height. Number of full-time workers increased. There have been a complete cohesion, coordination and mutual understanding at all level in the organisation. Poojniya Jagdeoramji`s magnetic personality acted as centre of gravity to which all the workers – big or small were emotionally attached, revolved around him as satellites move on their orbital paths without colliding each other. He was a father figure in the organisation not only by virtue of holding the top-most position but also by virtue of compassion and care of workers from top to bottom. Though very simple in appearance, very humble and soft spoken in approach, he was very assertive and commanding when situation demanded in the Sangathan. He had special inclination towards works and workers in ever-disturbed North-East Bharatvarsh. He advised Bhaskar Rao and Vasant Rao to bring maximum workers and resources from different parts of country to cater the ever-increasing needs of Kalyan Ashram in volcanic Poorvottar Bharat where the expansion work had to be undertaken with a sense of urgency and where resources – men and money were limited hurdling the expansion work. He was worried for the safety and security of karyakartas in this region. He very often cautioned me and Ram Nagina Yadav ji – “Beware of terrorist`s bullets. Take utmost precaution to keep you safe and secure. We have lost four senior workers in Tripura, three in Assam and one in Meghalaya. It should not happen in Nagaland and elsewhere in North-East Region.” He was a father figure in the organisation not only by virtue of holding the top-most position but also by virtue of compassion and care of workers from top to bottom. Though very simple in appearance, very humble and soft spoken in approach, he was very assertive and commanding when situation demanded in the Sangathan. He had special inclination towards works and workers in ever-disturbed North-East Bharatvarsh.  He was very happy when Janjati Dharma Sanskriti Suraksha Manch was constituted on 1, 2 April 2002 at Guwahati under the Presidentship of Bikram Bahadur Jamatiya of Tripura.

"In a first for the Siddi community, Shantaram Siddi nominated to Karnataka Legislative Council", 22-Jul-2020,,"A doyen in social service, Shantaram Siddi has done remarkable work for the welfare of many vanavasi communities all over India. He has been the member of Western Ghats Conservation Task Force, Konkani Sahitya Academy, and a dedicated Karyakarta of Vanavasi Kalyanashram since 1989. Sri Shantaram Siddi, a social activist, an eloquent speaker, an environmentalist has been nominated to the Karnataka Legislative Council. He is the first from the Siddi community, one of the most backward tribes of the state to be attaining this new responsibility. Sri Shantaram has done remarkable work for the welfare of many vanavasi communities all over India. Coming from a family with a poor economic and social background, pursuing education was not easy for Shantaram ji, but his determination and interest led him to become the first-ever graduate of the entire Siddi Community. Although he had many job opportunities, Shantaram ji plunged into social service under the guidance of his mentor Sri Prakash Kamat. Prakash ji once asked him “You may get a good job and comfortable life for yourself but what about the community of yours? The Siddis, don’t you want them to be in the mainstream?” This motivated Shantaram ji to work for the welfare of tribal community. Shantaram ji has been associated with Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram since 1989, working for the welfare of Janjati (tribal) people. He has worked extensively for the upliftment of Siddis, Gaulis, Lambanis, and many other tribes. He actively participated in many environment-conservation movements like Appiko Movement, Bedti River Valley Conservation Movement, and Vraksha–Laksha Andolana.  Apart from that, Shantaram ji has also contributed to the research on the uses and applications of medicinal plants, under the guidance of Dr. Yellappa Reddi. He was the member of Western Ghats Conservation Task Force, appointed by the Government of Karnataka. He was also a member of the Konkani Sahitya Academy. He joined Vanavasi Kalyanashram in 1989 as a Karyakarta, served as hostel warden and today he is the Secretary and Pranta Hitraksha Pramukh for the organisation. In 2018, Shantaram Siddi had spoken to the Organiser on the occasion of 'International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples' and said that ""The word ‘Adivasi’ itself is wrong. We must use words like Janjati, Budakattu, Girijana or Parishishta Pangada, which better reflects our status and ethos. Adivasi was coined as a conspiracy to divide us and separate people from each other. We are all one people"", he had told. Today he has been elected to the Upper House in Karnataka, a first for the Siddi community.

"Triple Talaq- Big Reform, Better Result: About 82% decline in triple talaq cases since law passed in 2019 against social evil, writes Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi", 23-Jul-2020,Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi,"The month of August is recognised as a “Month of Revolution, Rights & Reforms” in the Indian history; 08th August Quit India Movement, 15th August Independence Day, 19th August “World Humanitarian Day”, 20th August “Sadbhavana Diwas”, 370 was abolished on 5th August, these days have been written in golden pages of the Indian History. 1st August is a day which made Muslim women free from social evil of Triple Talaq; 1st August has been recorded in the country’s history as “Muslim Women Rights Day”. Triple Talaq or Talaq-a-Biddat was neither Islamic nor legal. Despite of the fact, the social evil of Triple Talaq was given “political patronage” by “Merchants of Votes”. 1st August 2019 is a historic day in Indian Parliamentary history when The Bill against Triple Talaq was made a Law despite of obstacle put by so-called “Champions of Secularism” including Congress, Communist Party, SP, BSP and Trinamool Congress. 1st August became the day which ensured gender equality and strengthened constitutional, fundamental and democratic rights of the Muslim women and it also gave confidence to the women, which constitute almost half of the population in India. 1st August will remain as a golden moment of Indian democracy and Parliamentary history. The law against social evil of Triple Talaq could have been passed in 1986 when the Hon’ble Supreme Court had given historic judgement in the Shahbano Case. The Congress had absolute majority in Parliament with more than 400 out of 545 Lok Sabha Members and more than 159 out of 245 Members in the Rajya Sabha. But the then Rajiv Gandhi Government used its strength in the Parliament to make the Supreme Court judgement ineffective and deprive the Muslim women of their constitutional and fundamental rights. The then Congress Government had bowed down before illogic of some “narrow minded fanatics” and committed a criminal sin to deprive the Muslim women of their constitutional rights. The Congress’ “Mistake of the Moment” became “Punishment of the Decades” for the Muslim women. The Congress was worried for “Vote Ka Udhaar” while our government was worried for “Samajik Sudhaar”(social reform). India runs on a Constitution, not on Shariat or any other religious textbook. Earlier, various legislations had been brought in the country to abolish social evils such as Sati Pratha and Child Marriage. Triple Talaq law has nothing to do with religion, the law has been made purely to ensure gender equality by ending a social evil, inhuman, cruel and unconstitutional practice. Instant divorce by verbally saying Talaq thrice is illegal. There were several incidents coming where women had been given Talaq through letter, phone or even through message and whatsapp. Such incidents are unacceptable to a sensitive country and to a government committed to inclusive development. Several Muslim-majority nations of the world had declared Triple Talaq as illegal and un-Islamic much earlier. Egypt was the first Muslim nation which abolished this social evil in 1929. Sudan in 1929, Pakistan in 1956, Bangladesh in 1972, Iraq in 1959, Syria in 1953, Malaysia in 1969 had abolished the practice of Triple Talaq. Besides, countries such as Cyprus, Jordan, Algeria, Iran, Brunei, Morocco, Qatar, UAE also ended this social evil many years ago. But it took 70 years for India to get rid of this inhuman and cruel practice. The Government led by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi made the law against Triple Talaq to make effective the Supreme Court’s judgement. The Supreme Court, on 18th May, 2017, had declared Triple Talaq as unconstitutional. By abolishing the Triple Talaq, the Modi Government has strengthened socio-economic, fundamental and constitutional rights of the Muslim women. One year has passed since the law against Triple Talaq was passed and there is a decline of about 82 per cent in Triple Talaq cases thereafter. If any such case was reported, the law has taken action. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s Government is committed to empowerment of all sections and social reforms. Some political parties give illogic that why the Modi Government is worried about Talaq in Muslim women? Why the Government don’t do anything for their socio-economic-educational empowerment? I want to make it clear to those people who ask such questions that during the last about 6 years, the Modi Government has worked with inclusive empowerment for every sections including Muslim women. The Modi Government’s efforts aimed at development of all sections have ensured welfare of Muslim women equally. During the last about 6 years, 3 crore 87 lakh Minority students have been given various scholarships which include about 60 per cent girl students. A large number of Muslim women have been provided employment and employment opportunities through “Hunar Haat”. More than 10 lakh Minority youths have been provided employment and employment opportunities through skill development schemes such as “Seekho aur Kamao”, “Garib Nawaz Swarojgar Yojna”, “Usttad”, “Nai Manzil”, “Nai Roushni” etc and more than 50 per cent beneficiaries are women.A total of 3040 women have performed Haj after the Modi Government ensured Muslim women can perform Haj without “Mehram” (male companion) in 2018. This year too, more than 2300 women had applied to perform Haj without Mehram. These women will be allowed to go to Haj 2021 on the basis of their application for Haj 2020 only. Besides, women who file new application, will also be allowed to go to Haj next year. The Modi Government’s efforts have benefitted equally to the Muslim women. Even the Opposition and “traditional Modi bashers” cannot raise question that there has been any discrimination with any community in welfare schemes. Our efforts for inclusive empowerment have shown results on the ground. When our Government provided 2 crore houses to poor, 31 per cent beneficiaries are from Minority community. Our Government has provided electricity to a large number of villages of the country which were deprived of electricity for decades, these villages include large number of Minority community dominated villages who were in darkness and now have been provided electricity. Our Government provided benefits to 22 crore farmers under ‘’Kisan Samman Nidhi” which include more than 33 per cent farmers belonging to Minority communities. About 37 per cent of more than 8 crore beneficiaries of “Ujjwala Yojna” providing free gas connection belong to Minority communities. Our Government provided easy loans to about 24 crore people under “Mudra Yojna” for small and medium business and other employment oriented economic activities and more than 36 per cent beneficiaries are from Minority communities. Muslim women have significantly been benefitted from these welfare schemes, they have become an equal partner of mainstream development.

Tribute to Galwan valley martyrs: Apartment in Bengaluru names corridor after Col Santhosh Babu, 26-Jul-2020,,"- VSK Karnataka In a unique tribute to the martyrdom of 20 soldiers in the Galwan Valley clash with occupationist forces of China, residents of Palm Haven apartment complex in the city have named a corridor in their premises after Col Santhosh Babu Corridor. Residents of Palm Haven under the leadership of Ajith Shetty Heranje planned to pay their tributes to the bravehearts who fought to safeguard our borders. As part of this, they put up a 70 ft wide banner with pictures of the soldiers who were martyred in the Galwan clash. The corridor in the apartment has been named as Col Santhosh Babu Corridor as part of their tribute. Colonel Bikkumalla Santosh Babu was an officer in the Indian Army and the commanding officer of 16 Bihar Regiment. He made the supreme sacrifice in Galwan Valley on 15 Jun 2020 while combating the occupationist Chinese PLA troops. It has been told that such a banner inside an apartment complex is the first of its kind anywhere in the country which serves the noble cause of remembering the soldiers guarding our borders. Ajith Shetty Herenje said that the remembrance of the martyrs and soldiers is getting restricted to special days in the calendar and the same does not qualify to be a healthy sign. We ought to remember our soldiers at all times as it is their dedication and perseverance on the borders which keeps us safe from enemies.

"Ram temple will become the Base of a strong and glorious Bharat: Dr. Surendra Jain, Central Joint General Secretary of VHP", 01-Aug-2020,,"            New Delhi, August 01, 2020 – The Central Joint General Secretary of Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Dr. Surendra Jain, has said that the Bhumi Pujan (Adoration of Earth Goddess) for Ram temple is a glorious moment for the country. No one can tarnish this fulcrum of national glory. The Hindu society fought continuously for 492 years to undo the debasing the signature superimposed by the foreign invader Babar on the birthplace temple of Sri Ram at Ayodhya.             In the latest mass struggle that started in 1984 CE, 160 million Ram Bhakts (devotees) and more than 3 Lakh villages of Bharat participated. This struggle continued till the historic verdict of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Bharat delivered on November 09, 2019. It was the result of this, one of its kind, cultural freedom struggle that Babar’s outlandish superimposed structure, that disgraced our pride and nationhood, is no longer there, and the resolve to build a stately temple to our great Patriarch Bhagwan Sri Ram is going to soon materialise steadily by degrees.             In a press conference held at New Delhi today, he said that the history of Ram Janmabhoomi movement is a rousing journey of pride of the country going ""From Self-Guilty/Troubled Conscience to Self-Confidence and Clear Conscience"". We won after nearly 1,000 years of continuous struggle against foreign invaders, but, the divisive, disruptive and discordant politics of pseudo-secularism tried to frustrate the country's self-esteem, cultural underpinning and bedrock. Hindu society was not only being divided on fictitious grounds, but also an insidious effort was on to plant a complex of inferiority in Hindu minds and hearts. This organic movement has expunged all manufactured and contrived fault-lines of division. Hindus have identified with one another, united and organized by rising above avowals of caste, creed, language, region, etc. Filled with pride, millions of Hindus today declare: “Garv se kaho Ham Hindu Hain” (Proudly say, we are Hindus). As a result of this self-respect, confidence and national pride, divisive politics of Bharat is disappearing from all walks of life. The entire country is now full of confidence and bringing welcome changes in every field of life for all round welfare. Also, Bharat is making its debut as a superpower on the global stage.             Dr. Jain further said that pride of nationality is an important motivating element for any country, but due to the politics of divisive appeasement, the definition of nationality of Bharat was confused, a national crisis of identity was being created. Now Bharat’s nationality cannot be linked to any foreign invader. It is the inspiring narratives of the patriarchs and matriarchs of the nation that will define this. Who can be a better Patriarch than Bhagwan Ram? It has been accepted by the constitution of the country itself.             The VHP's Joint General Secretary also said that the pace of this welcome change is increasing rapidly. By the time the Kalash (pinnacle pitcher) of Bhagwan Ram's temple is established, all the divisive elements would have become irrelevant and faded into oblivion and nothingness and the resolve of a new Bharat, with self-esteem, poise and self-reliance, would come true.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/1/Ram-temple-will-become-the-Base-of-a-strong-and-glorious-Bharat-VHP.html
"China knew about human-to-human transmission of Wuhan virus but did everything to cover it up and WHO remained silent, says Chinese Virologist", 11-Jul-2020,,"When virologist Yan Li-Meng presented her findings of human-to-human transmission capability of COVID-19, she was warned not to ""touch the red line"" and to be careful about her comments. She is currently in hiding at an undisclosed location fearing a threat to her life from Chinese authorities. Hong Kong university virologist Yan Li-Meng Chinese virologist Yan Li-Meng on has said The former researcher at the University of Hong Kong accused China of cover-up in an interview with Fox News. She said that she believed the Chinese authorities knew about the deadly virus well before it was made public. Yan, who previously worked at the university's World Health Organization (WHO) reference lab, also said her supervisors had ignored her research on human-to-human transmission at the start of the pandemic, which could potentially have saved many lives. Yan is currently in hiding at an undisclosed location fearing a threat to her life from Chinese authorities. Yan in the interview said that she fled Hong Kong for the U.S. on a Cathay Pacific flight on April 28, as she feared that she would be ""disappeared and killed"" by China just like other whistle-blowers if she shared her findings in Hong Kong. Yan said she had come to the US to narrate the truth of COVID-19 to the world and the role of China and WHO in the Pandemic. Yan reiterated that several Chinese scientists had tried to warn the public about the virus when the outbreak started but later were forced to either change their version or disappeared all of a sudden. Many were warned by the Chinese government not to pursue the matter. She informed Fox news that medical workers in China were prohibited from discussing the virus but were asked to wear masks. A Chinese news portal run from outside China,  Yan also claimed that WHO advisor Malik Peiris knew about the spread of the disease but chose not to take action. Peiris was the co-director of a WHO-affiliated lab but he stepped down on July 3. China has always claimed that it did not withhold information about the nature and its human-to-human transmission capability of the Wuhan virus. WHO which always toed China's line on the virus, had in January said that there was no proof of the human-to-human transmission of the virus. Now, after Yan's claims, both the versions of China and WHO stands contradicted. WHO Chairman Tedros had repeatedly said that he was in touch with Chinese scientists with respect to the spread of the Wuhan virus. But the many WHO authorities had claimed that the organisation received relevant information from scientists within the organisation and not from Chinese authorities as claimed by Tedros.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/11/China-knew-about-Wuhan-virus-but-did-everything-to-cover-it-up-and-WHO-remained-silent.html

""Our children are taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but that were villains,"" Trump said. “The violent mayhem we have seen in the streets of cities that are run by liberal Democrats, in every case, is the predictable result of years of extreme indoctrination and bias in education, journalism, and other cultural institutions.” “Against every law of society and nature, our children are taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but that were villains. The radical view of American history is a web of lies — all perspective is removed, every virtue is obscured, every motive is twisted, every fact is distorted, and every flaw is magnified until the history is purged and the record is disfigured beyond all recognition,” he said. Most private and public colleges and universities in the USA qualify for tax-exempt status. However, the Government criteria for tax exemption based on educational value says the process for determining if any ideological viewpoint is disqualifying for its status. ""Advocacy of a particular position or viewpoint may be educational if there is a sufficiently full and fair exposition of pertinent facts to permit an individual or the public to form an independent opinion or conclusion,"" it says. This week Fox News host Laura Ingraham said in a segment that liberals want schools to ""indoctrinate"" students, with a goal under a Biden administration of turning ""your kids into hard-core activists by remaking education from top to bottom."" Trump frequently tweets about her show. ""Every subject, every extracurricular activity will be perverted to turn your kids into mini Ilhan Omars,"" Ingraham said on her show Wednesday, referring to the Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota. ""Think about losing your child to the sort of whacked-out thinking that parents and alumni have allowed to dominate college campuses,"" she continued. In the USA, the violent George Iloyd protests have drawn ire from general public as Leftist universities were the epicenters of protests that have largely been aimed against the Trump administration. The Washington Examiner explained, “Universities in particular have become epicenters of protest activity that has largely been aimed against the Trump administration and its allies. Efforts to ‘cancel’ or interrupt controversial speakers have become the norm as well as adding public pressure on leadership to comply with demands that meet students’ standards of inclusivity and personal needs.” The report said, “Conservatives have long claimed that academia has been pushed to the left, and that trend has accelerated following the highly polarizing election of 2016. Trump and his conservative allies have accused universities of suppressing free speech toward students, staff, and visitors who don’t comply with left-wing ideology.” The Examiner noted a year ago Trump issued an executive order to make federal funding contingent on commitment to free speech. Last year, Trump also signed an executive order that threatened to withhold research-related funding to colleges and universities that do not uphold free speech on their campuses.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/11/Trump-asks-Treasury-Department-to-review-leftist-universities-tax-exemption.html
Islamist Turkey turns iconic ‘Church of Hagia Sophia’ into mosque: Erdogan’s announcement sparks fury among Christians, 11-Jul-2020,,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced Friday that the Hagia Sophia, ancient Christian Church, would be reopened for Muslim worship, sparking fury in the Christian community and neighbouring Greece. Clearing the way for converting the church into a mosque, a top Turkish court had revoked the sixth-century Byzantine monument's status as a museum. With Turkey announcing the conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque, it appears the prediction that Erdogan, a hardcore Islamist, wants to revive the Ottoman Caliphate by 2023, would come true. Built in AD 537, during the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian I, it was then the world's largest interior space and the first to employ a fully pendentive dome. The UNESCO World Heritage site in historic Istanbul, Hagia Sophia was a popular tourist attraction. It is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture and is said to have ""changed the history of architecture"". However, the cathedral was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453. In 1935, it was secularised into a museum. The Council of State, Turkey's highest administrative court, unanimously cancelled a 1934 cabinet decision to turn it into a museum and said Hagia Sophia was registered as a mosque in its property deeds. According to reports, the landmark ruling could inflame tensions not just with the West and Turkey's historic foe Greece but also Russia, with which Erdogan has forged an increasingly close partnership in recent years. Sharing a presidential decree which named Hagia Sophia as a ""mosque"", Erdogan announced its administration would be handed over to Turkey's religious affairs directorate known as Diyanet. ""May we be blessed,"" he commented. The decree was published on the official gazette. According to reports by news agency Agence France-Presse, a few hundred Turks carrying Turkish flags gathered outside Hagia Sophia shouting ""Chains broken, Hagia Sophia reopened"". 'Millions of Christians not heard' In a scathing attack on the move by Muslim-majority Turkey, Greece called it an ""open provocation to the civilised world"". ""The nationalism displayed by Erdogan... takes his country back six centuries,"" Culture Minister Lina Mendoni said in a statement. ""The concern of millions of Christians were not heard,"" Russian Orthodox Church spokesman Vladimir Legoida told Interfax news agency. The decision ""shows that all pleas regarding the need to handle the situation extremely delicately were ignored,"" he said. UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay said she ""deeply regrets"" the decision made without prior dialogue with the UN's cultural agency. The move was also condemned by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, which said it was an ""unequivocal politicisation"" of the monument.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/11/Islamist-Turkey-turns-iconic-Church-of-Hagia-Sophia-into-mosque.html
China’s ‘People’s Liberation Army’ is in reality CCP’s ‘Enslaving Army’, 12-Jul-2020,- Deepanshu Aggarwal,"In keeping with its convention of having utter disregard for either justice or sovereignty of others, China has utilised its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to do both: quell domestic dissent like Tiananmen Square massacre and set up bases in foreign countries whether through agreement or coercion. (Image source: www.thenarrativeworld.in) It is the 31st anniversary week of the Tiananmen Square massacre that took place in China and we are sharing a 10 days article series focusing on ten different topics (such as One Belt One Road Initiative, Strict media control, China’s border disputes etc.) to showcase how the Tiananmen Square massacre is not one isolated incident but the dragon’s inherent ideology in itself. This, a 4th day piece, divided into three-articles, will talk about China’s military expansionary plans under the garb of its much touted and advertised Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This article, the first, talks about China’s military expansionism in the African nation of Djibouti and Asian nations of Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Militaries across the countries in the world are tasked with a very crucial task of securing their respective countries’ international borders and territorial integrity. They guard the national frontiers day and night for the sole purpose of protecting the citizens of a country.Thus, wouldn’t it be strange and an injustice if a country begins to use its military in order to quell domestic dissent? Would it not be equally appalling if a country coerces other countries (whether through debt-diplomacy or in the name of ‘protecting’ infrastructural assets) into allowing its military to set its foot in those countries? In keeping with its ‘convention’ of having utter disregard for either justice or others’ sovereignty, China has utilised its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to do both : quell domestic dissent (Tiananmen Square massacre) and set up bases in foreign countries whether through agreement or coercion. Thus, the PLA is anything but ‘liberating’. Let’s consider the examples of Djibouti, an east African nation and Asian nations such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. Djibouti is an East African nation that lies at the strategic juncture of the Indian Ocean, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and controls the waters that lead to the famous and important sea route of the Suez Canal. Djibouti, exploiting its strategic location, as Bertil Lintner mentions in his book ‘The Costliest Pearl’ “..leases out its territory to foreign countries that want to set up military bases.” He also writes that following the US, France, Japan and a few other countries, China opened its military base therein in August 2017. The base was leased by Djibouti at a cost of $20 million a year and can house 10,000 troops. Though China has stated the base’s objective as protecting the sea traffic from ‘pirates’ in the region, it is widely considered a front for the country to grow its offshore military strength in its bid to be a superpower. The Chinese stated, as Bertil mentions “that the facility had nothing to do with military expansion and that it will be no more than a supply centre for their peacekeeping and humanitarian missions in the continent. But to many others, the best signifies China’s growing role in Africa and Beijing’s determination to secure its expanding interests in the Indian Ocean region.” Thus, combating piracy or aiding humanitarian activities is a charade beyond which lies the real motive of China – control the strategic ship routes in its bid to be a military and economic superpower. China, as part of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under its flagship Belt and Road Initiative, is developing the port of Gwadar in Pakistan. Gwadar lies at the strategic juncture of Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman and Strait of Hormuz. The port helps the Chinese landlocked province of Xinjiang connect to the Indian Ocean through a network of railway lines, roads etc. Considering Gwadar’s strategic location and provision of access to the Indian Ocean to an otherwise largely landlocked China has propelled the dragon to call its alliance with Pakistan an important one. The alliance has important economic underpinnings for both the countries. But it has military underpinnings too! As Bertil writes in his book “The alliance also includes military corporation ; the two countries have agreed to ‘safeguard the security of China Pakistan Economic Corridor’. But whether that extends to letting China set up permanent base in Pakistan remains to be seen. Bill Gertz, writing for The Washington Times, seems to think so. He says there are indications the Chinese have visited an area east of Gwadar on the Sonmiani Bay, a region known for its advanced computer centres, and ‘there are signs the Chinese are ready to build another boat facility at that location.’ Whether the base is going to be there or at Gwadar is not clear but ‘Chinese construction of the military activities in the port apper similar to what China did in Djibouti.’ If correct, China would soon have two military bases from which they could monitor and protect vital oil shipping routes from the Middle East. ”Imagine the plight of Indian security officials over India’s first Prime Minister after independence in 1947 – Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru not accepting the Sultan of Muscat and Oman’s offer of offering the port of Gwadar to India in the 1950s, upon which Pakistan bought it for $3 million in 1958. (Gwadar was given to the Sultan of Muscat in 1783 by Baluchi ruler Khan of Khalat) (Source : The Costliest Pearl book, by Bertil Lintner) Various security and geo-strategic analysts predict similar a experience for Myanmar, who like Sri Lanka,  is saddled with Chinese debt. Myanmar could soon experience its ‘Hambantota’ moment. Thus, China’s Belt and Road Initiative is nothing but a Chinese belt of debt and military expansion wrapped around its participating Asiatic neighbours and African/European countries along with a road that, China thinks, will lead to the dragon’s domination over the world. Next, in this 4th day series, we will discuss, through the second article in the series, the Chinese military plans in the Indian Oceanic islands of Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles.

Insensitive Chinese government denies funeral for its soldiers killed by Indian Army during Galwan clashes, 14-Jul-2020,,"The soldiers families are also prohibited from erecting gravestones as the Chinese government fears that images of gravestones of its fallen PLA soldiers could embarrass the CCP and stoke anti-Government sentiments if shared on social media. As per the assessment of US Intelligence agencies, XI Jinping's Government is pressuring the families of soldiers who were killed by the Indian Army during the Galwan classes in June not to conduct burials and in-person funeral ceremonies. This is an attempt by the CCP to cover up the entire episode to its own citizens and to the outside world which Beijing itself considers a blunder,  The news report says that Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs has told families of those who died in the Galwan Valley clash that they must forgo traditional burial ceremonies and cremate the soldiers' remains. They have also been instructed that funeral services should be conducted remotely and not in person. The orders to conduct the funerals in a clandestine way has been confirmed by the US Intelligence sources, says the US News report. The move to cover-up its failure to sense the Indian response to its misadventure and the bloody nose it received by the Indian Army is seen as a blunder within the government. In order to escape the embarrassment caused to the government and President Xi, the Chinese government has resorted to such dirty tactics. The Chinese government is using the threat of Corona infection as a pretext in public to deny the funerals for its fallen soldiers. No proper burial ceremony and funeral for these soldiers means that the families cannot erect gravestones or inscriptions over their graves. Chinese government reportedly fears that images of gravestones of its fallen PLA soldiers could further stoke anti-Government sentiments if they are spread on Chinese or international social media. The US Intelligence assessment concludes that the new rules are a part of a deliberate effort by Beijing to undermine public awareness and erase any enduring reminders of its loss during the Galwan clashes. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has on many previous occasions used such incidents to build support for itself in the country. The deadly incidents like the 2001 collision between a Chinese fighter jet and a U.S. spy plane near the southern Hainan Island or the accidental U.S. bombing in 1999 of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, were exploited by the CCP to build strong nationalistic support at home. But experts believe that the loss it faced in the Galwan Clashes were so big that the CCP does not want to embarrass itself in front of its citizens and the world. Hence, any news about the Galwan clashes have almost disappeared from Chinese media and official statements. US Intelligence sources see this as an indication that China did not intend for the June encounter to escalate and result in a huge loss of face and men. However, China's aim to hide the information from its own citizens has failed badly with Chinese citizens lambasting its government for not providing a decent funeral for its fallen soldiers. In June,  With this inhuman diktat, the Chinese government is also denying the families of the soldiers and their next generations from visiting the graves of their ancestors and pay respect to their loved ones.

"Education, Examination & Epidemic - Preparing for a world with COVID19", 04-Jul-2020,- Subbiah Shanmugam,"Given the natural history and biological behaviour of Covid19 pandemic in other parts of the world, we can conclude that it is going to stay for at least a few years. As long as an effective vaccine is widely available, norms of social distancing & wearing masks are going to stay.      Every one of us eagerly expects an early end of the Covid19 pandemic. But if the natural history and biological behaviour of Covid19 pandemic in other parts of the world are any indications, we can conclude that it is going to stay here for at least a few years. As long as an effective vaccine is widely available, norms of social distancing & wearing masks are going to stay. In such a scenario, what will be its impact on education in general and medical education, in particular, is worth to be thought over. The reason for my priority for medical education is because institutions of medical education are doubling up as institutions managing the pandemic also. Already the sole priority of all institutions in the world in general and our country in particular, is the management of pandemic, at the cost of educational activities in medical educational institutions. When I was discussing examinations in medical education with one of the medical universities in the country, she expressed her opinion that all medical teachers are very busy in pandemic activities, and examinations can wait for some 6 months to a year in such an extreme emergency. What she failed to mention, but having in her mind maybe even education in the medical field can also wait for some months to a year at least. All the freshers out of their undergraduate programs into internships and all post graduate students who are joining courses are being recruited for pandemic activities in one way or another.      Further with an average minimum intake of around 150 students in each year in every medical college, where by default the entire batch moves around as one class without any sections, how to maintain social distancing while educating is a big question to be dealt with. At anatomy dissection halls and further into clinical classes, medical students usually have a habit of making a crowd around a teacher standing near every embalmed body in anatomy hall and every patient in clinical classes. Many a time the crowd is more if the teacher is more communicative. It is an enterprising and thrilling experience for each and every medical student in both situations. When I hear from the youngsters that medical education has become stressful, I used to wonder. Because in my opinion, no other branch of education can be so enterprising than medical education from the start to finish.      As we enter our first year of medical college, in the first week itself we are left to face embalmed, naked dead bodies in dissection halls. It is the only one occasion other than childhood, both sexes being naked is never bothered about. As we go near embalmed bodies in groups, shed our fear, anxiety and hesitation, and start dissecting the human anatomy, we are so absorbed in our classrooms we never complain about boredom. On most of the days, we will be returning from dissection classes with dress soiled by embalming fluid, red dye and even small body pieces sometimes. I don't remember whether I was wearing a glove while dissecting the embalmed body 36 years ago. Every night in bed, as a medical student, I will be planning the dissection of dead bodies on the next day very eagerly. We miss classrooms but never miss dissection halls. In dissection halls, even in government medical colleges where dead bodies for dissection is not scarcity, students are made to crowd around limbs, abdomen, chest and head of each body being dissected. How to manage social distancing there will be a very big question in the coming days.      As we enter our clinical classes, where no one case scenario is similar to the other one, it will be so interesting that we never miss a single day clinical class while not bothering about lecture classes in the afternoon, after lunch. Many times we will be sleeping in lecture classes or counting the mistakes committed by the lecturer if we have read the topic already on our own. Clinical classes, wearing half hand, short white coats prescribed for students, crowding around a clinical teacher in his long full hand white coat by the side of the patient is a routine scene in medical college hospitals. While the ambition of each and every medical student will be wearing long full hand white coats of teachers with as many bells as possible at the patient end of stethoscopes, crowded all around them by young energetic students. Only after becoming a teacher, you start complaining about wearing full hand white coats which are very difficult to maintain clean; young students, both boys and girls, are eager to hear you, jostling among themselves and sometimes even falling one you; having to repeat the same subjects with new jokes and tone, etc. At Least you can imagine and afford to have mannequins to replace or add to the bodies being dissected in anatomy halls but you can’t replace patients, who are the vital learning material for every medical student, with anything.      At outpatient set up, in most of the government hospitals where patients make a long queue to have few minutes of doctor’s attention in close quarters, how to keep social distancing without losing emotional connect and clinical acumen will be a big challenge. At the operation theatre, usually, the surgical teacher will be almost rubbing shoulders with staff nurses and assistant surgeons assisting him while operating and students falling over his head to have a glimpse of the anatomy they learnt on dead embalmed bodies in real-time scenario on living human beings who are being operated on. At wards also, teaching happens in groups of students crowding around the teacher.       In clinical exams, the student should emotionally connect to the patient whom he has not met in the past and may not be having another occasion to examine in future also, to elicit vital clinical signs in precious one hour in the case of the long case and thirty minutes in the case of a short case. The student is expected to examine the patient's mouth, nose and throat. On some occasions, even patients are asked to cough repeatedly to elicit clinical findings. Success or failure of making the patient cooperative and eliciting clinical findings will make the difference between success and failure in the exam too. In clinical examinations, there will be four examiners examining one candidate at a time, and definitely, you can’t afford to use mike so that you can maintain social distancing because the same patient with same clinical findings, same questions and answers will be repeated to umpteen number candidates in the same day. For all these issues, you can’t do away with the clinical classes and exams because producing doctors good only in writing on paper will be detrimental to society in future.      Here, on the whole, I tried to stress the difference between medical education and other branches of education. In medical education, the study material is patients, their examination and procedures performed on them. Hence, you can’t repeat many sittings on the same day, so as to have less crowd of students and more social distancing. At least for one or two years, these issues will be very pertinent in medical education. In the same time duration, time and energy of medical teachers will be spent more on control of pandemic too. This will double up the issues faced by medical education. Chances of students and teachers themselves getting from their study material, that is patient will be the real one. When you are going to quarantine those students and teachers getting infected, the cycle of burden leading to more burden will be repeated with no end. I wished to bring about all these issues, in addition to the many more issues that escaped my imagination in the few hours of the late night I wrote this article, just because it will not be known outside medical circles commonly. And at the end, those in the seat power of administration may not come to know about all these issues. Medical fraternity, which is very busy in fighting the pandemic, may not have time to think about all these issues in the coming few years. I place these facts in the public domain for understanding, thinking and acting. For nothing else, I wrote on these issues.

"Christian persecution continues in China: Chinese Communist Party orders Christians to destroy crosses on their churches, take down images of Jesus and put pictures of Mao and Xi Jinping", 23-Jul-2020,,"Chinese officials have ordered Christians to destroy the crosses on their churches and remove images of Jesus from their homes. They also demanded religious images be replaced with pictures of Communist leaders at the homes of impoverished believers, said independent outlet Bitter Winter. Authorities have recently destroyed religious symbols by force in churches in multiple provinces, including Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei and Zhejiang, according to US-based news site Radio Free Asia. Officials in charge of religious affairs in Huainan in the eastern province of Anhui allegedly barged into the local Shiwan Christ Church to dismantle its cross on Saturday and Sunday, reported the Daily Mail. ‘When they arrived at the venue to impose the order by force at the weekend, they were met with dozens of believers who had gathered to try to prevent them from bulldozing the holy sign,’ reported Radio Free Asia citing local sources. The government reportedly sent a crane and nearly 100 workers to demolish the crosses on Ao'di Christ Church and Yinchang Christ Church. Similar incidents were said to occur in Yongjia in Zhejiang Province on July 7. Local believers told US-based pressure group China Aid that government workers forced their way into the churches, smashed the churches' properties and beat up the Christians, including a woman in her 80s, who tried to stop them. A local government of Linfen in Shanxi Province summoned all village officials and directed them to crack down on religious activity, reported Bitter Winter. The new developments are a continuation of the China's ruling Communist Party’s campaign, a widespread clampdown on all religious institutions in recent years. Chinese President Xi Jinping had ordered that all religions must 'Sinicise' to ensure they are loyal to the officially atheistic party. In November last year, the Chinese central government ordered its censors to review and edit all translated versions of classic religious books to make sure that their messages reflect the principles of Socialism. The order was given in November during a meeting held by the Committee for Ethnic and Religious Affairs of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which oversees the ethnic and religious matters in China. The meeting was supervised by Wang Yang, Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. “Wang stressed that religious authorities must follow President Xi's instructions and interpret the ideologies of different religions in accordance with 'the core values of Socialism' and 'the requirements of the era'. He urged the officials to build 'a religious system with Chinese characteristics',” reported the Daily Mail.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/23/Christian-persecution-continues-in-China.html
"US orders China to shut its Houston consulate for indulging in IP theft, spying and influence operations; Retaliatory move expected", 22-Jul-2020,,"In an unprecedented move, the United States government has ordered China to cease all operations and events at its consulate in Houston, Texas. The US State Department has said the consulate was directed to close ""in order to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information"" but has not elaborated on the details that led to the decision. A spokesperson for the  Responding to the closure of its Houston consulate, the Chinese Foreign Ministry called it an ""unprecedented escalation"" by Washington. In a statement posted on its official social media,  The Trump administration has informed that Chinese diplomats in Texas to clear out by Friday. Eye-witnesses have said that the Chinese officials were seen burning a trove of documents and other materials as soon as the decision to shut the consulate was made public. Smoke was seen coming out of the windows of the Chinese consulate in Houston. Fire tenders at the spot were not immediately allowed to douse the fire at the Chinese consulate in Houston It is not exactly known as to what was being burnt by the Chinese officials though it is expected that incriminating documents and records were being destroyed to cover its tracks in view of the allegations of IP theft, spying and influence operations by the US. It is alleged that Chinese consulate was burning documents/evidences as it did not allow the fire services to douse the fire. Relations between the United States and China have plummeted during the last year due to trade war, origin and spread of Corona pandemic, China's human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. China has also been repeatedly accused of indulging in Intellectual Property (IP) theft of wide ranging technologies and products. Few estimates suggest that Chinese theft of US IP and trade secrets to be around $300bn-$600bn a year. In January this year, FBI had identified China as the biggest law enforcement threat to the United States and said that Beijing was seeking to steal American technology by “any means necessary”. FBI had arrested 24 people in 2019 in IP theft and spying on US assets-related cases and has already arrested 19 people in 2020. The US move to shut one of China's consulates indicates that the Communist country has been caught involved in massive spying operations in the US and also in influencing incidents there. China has been accused of providing support to the recent riots that engulfed the US over the killing of an African American. China had hit back at the US for supporting Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations and instead had asked it to curb racism in its police force.

"Russia says Coronavirus vaccine is tested and safe, plans to launch by mid-August: Reports", 16-Jul-2020,,"The vaccine tested at the Burdenko Main Military Clinical Hospital is safe and well-tolerated, the Russian Defense Ministry, Russian news agency TASS reported on Wednesday. ""The available data based on laboratory and instrumental research makes it possible to say that the vaccine is safe and well-tolerated,"" the ministry said. According to the report, eighteen volunteers took part in the vaccine trials. Their vital signs were within normal limits for 28 days after the vaccination. According to the Defense Ministry, on the 42nd day after the first vaccination, volunteers will have to return to the hospital for the final medical examination and diagnostics. Russian scientists had claimed on Monday that they hope to launch the world’s first coronavirus as soon as next month, as per report. On Sunday, Russia’s Sechenov University said that it had successfully completed clinical trials of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by the state-run Gamalei Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. The head and chief researcher at Sechenov University Center for Clinical Research on Medications Elena Smolyarchuk told Russian news agency TASS that clinical trials of the vaccine on volunteers have been completed and study data showed the candidate’s effectiveness. “The research has been completed and it proved that the vaccine is safe,” Smolyarchuk was quoted as saying by TASS of its trial. The Gamalei center’s director Alexander Gintsburg told TASS that he hopes the vaccine will ‘enter civil circulation’ on August 12-14, adding that private companies may begin mass production by September, The Moscow Times reported. According to The Moscow Times report, Smolyarchuk had said earlier in July that some participants developed typical responses to injections like headaches, elevated body temperatures. However, these symptoms were resolved within 24 hours. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation’s protocols said that a vaccine has to go through three phases of studies before being approved for large-scale production.

Why the World should be Wary of Huawei's 5G Infrastructure?, 19-Jul-2020,,"- Dr Gulrez Sheikh Before we get into specifics, let us discuss what critical infrastructure means? Critical infrastructure is the one, which, when disrupted, has the potential of adversely affecting a country’s security, economy, transportation etc. Power of 5G technology and how is it critical for a nation- The power of 5G is its 100 times more speed than 4G, enabling the always-on firms, highly mobile consumers and fully connected national and global societies/markets. 5G is a vehicle for the new industrial revolution, inflow and outflow of information, smart cities and citizens, telemedicine and telesurgery, driverless transport and things ranging from refrigeration to babysitting. It enables complex networks to interact with each other with a minimal relative period. Hence it becomes a critical infrastructure. Now coming to Huawei, looking at its price list, it is the best player for 5G hardware. But there are risks involved with this good cheaper option. The  Article 9 Article 14 So any Chinese firm or even an individual legally becomes an intelligence-gathering tool. Hence for considerations of the national security, any Chinese citizen/organisation/company needs to be seen as an extension of the Chinese deep-state. Now combine this with China’s support to Pakistan, its constant foster of animosity for India vis a vis neighbouring countries, its opposition to India joining the UNCS, tensions on our eastern front, makes a very strong case against Huawei. Thus India should not allow Huawei to enter the country for the sake of national security. The countries like US, UK, Australia, France etc. have banned Huawei for the reason of national security, but India’s case is different from them, as none of them shares a border with China. So even if (in coming months, irrespective of who’s in the Oval Office) they allow Huawei, we shouldn’t. But as per my view, we should not ban Huawei either. Let it act as a price watchdog for 5G hardware providers like Nokia, Ericsson etc., but Indian companies won’t give a contract to Huawei because of public sentiments against China. We have only four telecom companies including BSNL, and to save money, none can dare to go against consumer sentiments and loose customers.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/19/Why-World-should-be-Wary-of-Huawei-and-its-5G-Infrastructure.html
"#BoycottChina gains steam worldwide - After Britain bans Huawei for 5G trials, Italy contemplating the same", 16-Jul-2020,,"On July 15th, 2020, Britain's government took a The British announcement is very significant that governments the world over are ready to face losses in order to stop China from gaining foothold in their country. Huawei is accused of close ties with the Chinese Communist Government and is also said to part of its electronic surveillance network. The US, especially President Trump, has warned all allies to desist from allowing the Chinese company in 5G trials which could be detrimental to the countries digital assets. Britain has also cited China's crackdown on Hong Kong pro-Democracy activists and Beijing’s lack of transparency on the origins of the coronavirus as the reasons for banning Huawei. With this decision, Britain will phase out all Huawei 5G equipment installed in recent months and has also mandated that private providers should remove or replace Huawei gear over the next few years. Italy to ban Huawei soon Close on the move of Britain banning Huawei, the Italian government is said to be contemplating the same over similar concerns. Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that Italy is considering whether to exclude Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies from building its 5G network.  Last year, parliamentary security committee Copasir said Italy should consider blocking Chinese telecoms firms Huawei and ZTE from taking part in development of 5G networks. The Italian government is said to be considering the suggestion of Copasir seriously along with emerging concerns over China's continued spying and attempts to create unrest in other countries using the digital assets and equipment of its companies. World Boycotts China The United States has effectively banned Huawei and other Chinese companies from participating in its 5G trials over allegations of spying for the CCP. The Trump administration has also persuaded its allies to follow suit. In May, the  Apart from Britain, 27 other European governments have agreed to a common approach to mitigate 5G security risks. However, each country is free to implement 5G in their own way. Countries like France and Netherlands have passed laws that allow the government to veto a private carrier’s choice of a 5G provider. Belgium has already banned “high risk” vendors like Huawei and ZTE in their core network and has capped their presence at 35 percent in the periphery. Japan and South Korea have made rules that effectively exclude Chinese companies from being part of 5G. In Israel, no Chinese companies have been part of their 3G and 4G platforms and they will be kept out of 5G as well.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/16/After-Britain-bans-Huawei-for-5G-trials-Italy-contemplating-the-same.html

"#Shocking China entered covert deal with Pakistan military for bio-warfare capabilities against India, Western countries: Report", 24-Jul-2020,,"As part of a broader offensive against India and Western rivals, Pakistan and China have entered a secret three-year agreement to expand potential bio-warfare capabilities, including several research projects related to the deadly agent anthrax, the Klaxon reported citing multiple intelligence sources. The report comes when China is being criticised for handling of coronavirus pandemic with speculations that disease could have emerged from Wuhan Institute of Virology. ANI quoted the report authored by Anthony Klan and reported that the same lab has signed the covert deal with Pakistan military's Defense Science and Technology Organization (DESTO), to collaborate research in ""emerging infectious diseases"" and advance studies on the biological control of transmitted diseases. As per the intelligence sources cited by The Klaxon, they have serious concerns about the covert project which involves testing biological agents outside its borders to minimize the ""risk of drawing condemnation from the international community"". China has been accused over its opaqueness in the handling of coronavirus as crucial information of the lethal virus was not revealed in the early days of the outbreak which could have helped the pandemic to be tackled more effectively. The infamous Wuhan Lab had ""lent all financial, material and scientific support for the project"". The program being entirely funded by China is formally titled ""Collaboration for Emerging Infectious Diseases and Studies on Biological Control of Vector Transmitting Diseases"", according to the report. One senior intelligence source was quoted as saying that DESTO has been engaged in various dual-use research projects related to anthrax under a covert biological weapons program. The Klaxon report said the ""covert China Pakistan project has conducted ""successful soil sampling tests"" to isolate Bacillus Thuringiensis (BT), which has a ""striking similarity"" to Bacillus Anthracis - or anthrax."" ""Considering the striking similarity between BT and Bacillus Anthracis, a classified bio-warfare agent, (Pakistan's) improved know-how in handling the bacteria could enrich a potential offensive biological program,"" a source was quoted as saying. ""The Wuhan Lab has provided Pakistan with reagents for Bacillus Thuringiensis. It was also providing ""extensive training on the manipulation of pathogens and bio-informatics"" to Pakistani scientists ""to help Pakistan develop its own virus collection database"", said the report. According to an intelligence source cited by the outlet, this could help Pakistan ""enhance its capability of genetic identification of viruses, access to dangerous microorganisms, and use of genomic tools for research and infectious diseases."" The secret project was ""detached from supervision of civilian universities or government health departments in Pakistan"" and was structured so as to allow unspecified operations, the report said. Quoting a source, the report states that the agreement ""clearly outlines that the cooperation is not necessarily limited to stated objectives"" and ""new thematic research to monitor potential new diseases can be added by either party"". China's involvement in the project is being viewed by India and key western intelligence agencies as being ""driven chiefly by its agenda to engage Pakistan against India,"" a security expert told The Klaxon on condition of anonymity. ”China's keen interest in the project is driven chiefly by its agenda to engage Pakistan against India and to conduct potentially dangerous experiments on foreign soil, without subjecting its own land and people to risk,"" the expert said. The report says, the plan was a part of a move by Beijing to ""designate Pakistan a destination for hazardous bio chemical research"" while ""evading use of its own territory for such activities"", which ""stand the risk of drawing criticism and condemnation from the international community"". Sources told The Klaxon that the China-Pakistan biological project had already undertaken experiments on the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, a rapid-onset fever virus that causes death in about 25% of cases and is similar to the Ebola virus. Pakistan is allegedly carrying out tests on CCHFV in laboratories which are not equipped to handle Bio-Safety Level-4 diseases, the report stated. According to reports, China is heavily involved in DNA research that could potentially enable a biological weapon to target, or be ineffective against, people of specific races. Intelligence sources cited by The Klaxon said there were concerns the Wuhan Institute of Virology had also established the Institute of Medical Biology in Kunming in China's southern Yunnan province. There were concerns the Kunming facility, which is controlled by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, was also handling class-4 diseases without proper protections, the report said.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/24/China-entered-covert-deal-with-Pakistan-military.html

China versus Rest of the World, 23-Jul-2020,,"It is evident that China is fast losing friends, besides the US, in Europe too. With its expansionist agenda becoming more and more pronounced, it is a question of time before China is totally cut off from the international community and gets branded a pariah state. (Image source: Nobat.com) Is it possible for someone to “gang up” against a group? Though it may be perceived as impossible, yet that is precisely what is happening in today's global scenario. A single country has practically ganged up against the rest of the world! Despite being the second biggest world economy, it has been noted for blatantly practising unethical means, including war, to secure its end goal of establishing unchallenged supremacy in global politics. This rogue communist country believes that no price is too high nor any means too unethical to reach the seat of commandeering the world affairs. Seen through the prism of international perceptions, it could, therefore, be truthfully stated without an iota of prejudice that China has verily achieved the mission impossible. All Time Low in Relations China has already hit an all-time low in international relations. The litany of charges by the peace-loving free world against China is practically endless: human-rights violations, ruthlessly suppressing political dissension, ethnic cleansing, refusing civil liberties to the people of Hong Kong, rejecting Tibetans’ right to self-determination, coveting an independent Taiwan, grabbing by force swathes of territories from unwary neighbouring countries and laying claims on places and areas that are part of established nations. Furthermore, China has also been bullying and lording over the South China Sea and the East China Sea where it has made many a territorial claim, openly supporting international terrorist groups by extending financial assistance and weapons and training them to subvert the stability of nations like India, which are competing with it in the economic sphere. In addition to the above, China has been single-handedly responsible for bringing about the global economy to a near collapse. The coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan in China and its worldwide spread was the trigger point. More than the outbreak of the pandemic, it was the mishandling of the killer virus in ground zero that turned the world against China. The rogue nation’s secretive ways of concealing the truth about the origin of the virus and its audacious refusal to cooperate with the other countries to reach the heart of the problem in order to come up with a cure clinched the issue. It became more and more apparent with the passing of time that there was much steam in the conspiracy theory that the novel coronavirus was man-made with the intention of using it as a weapon against the prevailing world order. It was obvious that the Chinese world view was grossly at variance with the existing world order. It is no wonder, therefore, that the world is seeking to establish a new world order where there would be a distinct delineation of China's place in the international affairs in the post-Covid-19 era. Suffice it to say that China has painted itself to a corner. It needs to be seen as to how long can a friendless China sustain its economy before it succumbs to the combined pressure by a realigned and fast-emerging new world order in the post-Covid-19 era. US-China Relations In the past, the US and China were engaged in disputes focussed on trade imbalance and the technology front that triggered trade wars, with the fallout of escalation of tariffs.  Now they are fighting on more fronts ranging from the origin of the novel coronavirus to Hong Kong to the South China Sea to race for supremacy in the military and artificial intelligence field. Earlier, the US had special arrangements for preferential financial treatment for Hong Kong. Now with the tightening of the Chinese control over Hong Kong, the US position of special arrangements is becoming opaque, if not downright murky. International experts have expressed concern over fears that the US-China relations are in for the darkest chapter yet. The US has accused China of stealing intellectual property and violating tariff and subsidies set down by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the World Trade Organization. It has staked a claim for retribution against China for the disastrous consequences to its economy caused by the pandemic. Several countries have joined the US in making similar claims. (Image source: DainikBhaskar.com) Trade analysts and political observers believe that China may prefer the re-election of President Trump over former Vice President Joe Biden. The re-election of Trump is likely to be followed by more bluster, threats and higher tariffs, whereas the election of Biden may throw up uncertain times ahead. President Trump is known to have sent in the past his traditional European allies into a tailspin by openly criticising them with his America First policy. However, he may still be expected to carry their support in the matter of arraigning China for recalcitrance. Japan-China Japan has disputes with China over the Senkaku Islands in the South China Sea and Ryuku Islands and the Air Defence Identification Zone and the Exclusive Economic Zone in the East China Sea. In the wake of the Galwan Valley incident precipitated by China, Japan has initiated a legal process to change the legal status of the Senkaku Islands. This, together with Japan's participation in the Quad talks with the US, India and Australia, has angered China. Japan has expressed concern over the recent sighting of a submarine, suspected to be Chinese, close to the Japanese territorial waters. It has also spoken about the need to raise awareness about China's intentions and capabilities, citing references to China's actions in Hong Kong and the South China Sea and military action along the India-China border in Tibet. In the given circumstances, Japan is considering the acquisition of pre-emptive capabilities to strike down anti-missile launchers. Britain-China Britain's relations with China started deteriorating when the former offered the political dissidents in Hong Kong citizenship rights following the Chinese clampdown on Hong Kong. The relationship took a further hit when Britain joined the chorus for a free international probe into the origin of the novel coronavirus. Britain has since banned the Chinese tech giant Huawei from bidding for expansion of the 5G network. China has warned of repercussions. Meanwhile, Britain is bracing for a crippling cyberattack as happened in Australia recently. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has recently stated that the increasing influence of China in geopolitics has led to a shift in the global balance of power. He has also warned that China was coming ever closer to Europe's doorstep, which must be fought together by the NATO allies. It is evident that China is fast losing friends, besides the US, in Europe too. Already in the diplomatic doghouse of many a country, China’s sole lifeline in international relations is dependent on its economic and trade ties. With its expansionist agenda becoming more and more pronounced, it is a question of time before China is totally cut off from the international community and gets branded a pariah state. Stretched to Tether's End Besides the growing political dissension among the intelligentsia, divisive fissiparous tendencies within CCP coming to the fore and secessionist forces waiting to break away from the stranglehold of the totalitarian regime, China is facing a new threat. How long can a friendless China sustain its economy before it succumbs to the combined pressure by a realigned and fast-emerging new world order in the post-Covid-19 era is a moot point that now demands serious consideration.

China converts mosques into public toilets in Xinjiang province, 17-Aug-2020,,"The Chinese Communist government is converting mosques into public toilets in Xinjiang province. Quoting a local official, international media reported that a public washroom has been constructed on the site of a demolished mosque in Atush of Xinjiang province in northwestern China. The construction of the lavatory on the former site of Tokul mosque in Atush's Suntagh village is part of a campaign, observers say, aimed at hurting the sentiments of the Uyghur Muslims, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported. Reports of the restroom's construction on the demolished Tokul mosque site surfaced days after RFA's Uyghur Service learned that authorities had demolished two of three mosques there in a drive launched in late 2016 to raze Muslim places of worship, known as ""Mosque Rectification."" The campaign, part of a series of hardline policies under Chinese President Xi Jinping, comes as Beijing is carrying out the mass incarceration of 1.8 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in its internment camps across Xinjiang since April 2017. In a telephonic interview with RFA, an Uyghur neighbourhood committee chief from Suntagh village in Atush, said that Tokul mosque was demolished in 2018 and the public washroom was erected in its place by ""Han (Chinese) comrades."" ""It is a public toilet ... they have not opened it yet, but it has been built,"" he said while speaking on condition of anonymity citing fear of reprisal. Asked if there was the need to construct a public toilet on the razed mosque site, the committee chief said, ""People have toilets at home, so there were not any problems like that."" He said that Suntagh is situated about three kilometres outside of central Atush and the area sees few to no tourists who would require access to the lavatory. However, the committee chief disclosed that the public washroom was likely built to cover up the debris of the demolished Tokul mosque, as well as for the needs of inspecting groups or cadres visiting the area. A resident of Suntagh, who refused to be identified, said that one of the two mosques in the village were razed in or around autumn of 2019. A ""convenience store"" has come up at the former site of Azna mosque and the shop sells alcohol and cigarettes, both of which are forbidden in Islam. According to a report in 2016, a local official in Hotan prefecture's Lop county reported that authorities were mulling to use the site of a former mosque to open an ""activities centre"" as a spot for entertainment. Another official in Hotan city's Ilchi township told RFA had said that a former mosque site would be converted into a factory to produce underwear for a Sichuan-based company. According to reports, apart from mosques, the Chinese authorities have been systematically destroying Muslim cemeteries and other religious structures across Xinjiang since 2016. Last year, the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project (UHRP) published a report titled ""Demolishing Faith: The Destruction and Desecration of Uyghurs Mosques and Shrines,"" saying that the campaign uses geolocation and other techniques and has led to the destruction of between 10,000 and 15,000 mosques, shrines and other religious sites in the region between 2016 and 2019. Qahar Barat, an Uyghur historian, recently told RFA that the demolition of religious places in Xinjiang constitutes a kind of ""spirit breaking."" He called on government and Muslim organisations in the Muslim world to take stern action against China's activities, which he described as a ""declaration of war on Islam."" Authorities have recently destroyed religious symbols by force in churches in multiple provinces, including Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei and Zhejiang, according to US-based news site Radio Free Asia.

"Zakir Naik claims India has a Muslim population of 30 crores, urges Indian Muslims to do Hijra to Kerala and form an exclusive Muslim political party!", 23-Aug-2020,,"Radical Islamic preacher and televangelist Zakir Naik uploaded a video on his Facebook channel, in which he urged the Indian Muslims to do ‘Hijra’ to Kerala, where ‘the BJP Government doesn’t have much hold’. While answering to a question on how Indian Muslims should ‘tackle’ the BJP government, he said that Muslims who could not move out of the country could go to another state, ""which is more lenient towards Muslims"". ""In the last four-to-six years, there is an onslaught on Muslim minorities in India. There are a lot of lynchings, attacks..."" Zakir Naik claimed in his speech. He also alleged there was a lot of oppression and persecution under the current government. He said that Indian Muslims are divided on the basis of ""different sects in Islam, and belonging to different political parties and social organisations"". “The Indian Muslims as a whole should be united,” he added. Naik claimed that there are ""actually 250 million to 300 million Muslims"". He also alleged that the Government of India is suppressing the real population of Indian Muslims. According to the census reports, the Muslims are around 200 million. Naik declared India is the country with the world's largest Muslim population. Zakir Naik then declared, ""Muslims should make another party, exclusively, only for Muslims"". ""This political party should join hands with other political parties that are not Fascist and not communal,"" he added. He also advised the Muslim community that such a Muslim political party should join hands with Dalits, adding ""Dalits are not Hindus"". Twisting the historical facts, Zakir Naik falsely claimed that Babasaheb Ambedkar wanted to join Islam! “Babasaheb Ambedkar loved Islam. He wanted to join Islam, but unfortunately, the Muslims didn't welcome him, so he chose the second-best... he chose Buddhism"".  Zakir Naik said such a political alliance of Muslims and Dalits would represent nearly 600 million people and be a major force. Naik urged the Indian Muslims to do Hijra (migration) to other countries or states if they are a minority where they live. ""If you have the means to go to a Muslim-majority country, that should be the best,"" Zakir Naik said.  He said that he did ""not expect"" all Muslims of India to leave the country. Naik suggested that Kerala is the best state he can think of! Zakir Naik claimed that followers of all three major religions—Hindus, Muslims and Christians—each accounted for about one-third of the population of Kerala. ""The people of Kerala are not communal in nature. The people of different religions live harmoniously. There is no friction between different religions. This government (BJP) doesn't have much hold in the state of Kerala. So, one of the best options if you want to do Hijira to another state, I would say, is Kerala,"" Zakir Naik said. He also said that Bombay and Hyderabad are less communal states but Uttar Pradesh is very communal.

China displays its hooligan behaviour again - Threatens Norway against giving Nobel Peace Prize to Hong Kong protesters, 29-Aug-2020,,"China has warned Norway against giving a Nobel Peace Prize to Hong Kong protesters, who have been hailed across the world for standing up to the authoritarian and dictatorial Chinese regime which curtailed the Island's autonomy. The In response to a question about Hong Kong's pro-democracy demonstrations, Wang Yi said ""We don't want to see anyone politicising the Nobel Peace Prize. China will firmly reject any attempt by anyone to use the Nobel Peace Prize to interfere in China's internal affairs, as it had done in the past."" China which has been on the receiving end ever since the origin of the Corona Virus was traced to Wuhan and it was accused of not doing enough to alert the world, has been on a diplomatic overdrive to mend its ties. However, given its authoritarian attitude, China has either tried to force countries to toe its line with financial instruments or through sanctions. In 2010, the Nobel  Peace Prize was awarded to Chinese democracy advocate Liu Xiaobo. Though the Norwegian government doesn't have any say in who is awarded the prize, China responded by suspending ties and freezing free-trade talks. Ever since then, the relations between Oslo and Beijing have been turbulent. The recent business tensions with many countries in Europe has added to China's offensive attitude. Many democratic countries around the world including many in Europe have criticised China for suppressing the Hong Kong protesters using force and also for curtailing democracy in the Island. It's controversial national security law for Hong Kong was enacted in June, raising concerns about autonomy and basic freedoms of its citizens.

"Sudan ends 30 year rule of Islamic law, separating religion and state", 08-Sep-2020,,"Sudan’s transitional government has agreed to separate religion from the state, ending 30 years of Islamic rule in the country. Sudanese Prime minister Abdalla Hamdok and Leader of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North rebel group Abdel-Aziz al-Hilu signed the declaration in Addis Ababa on Thursday. “For Sudan to become a democratic country where the rights of all citizens are enshrined, the constitution should be based on the principle of ‘separation of religion and state,’ in the absence of which the right to self-determination must be respected,” the declaration stated. The decision comes less than a week after the government signed a peace deal with rebel forces. The United States labelled Sudan a terror sponsor in 1993 and later imposed sanctions until 2017. Islam is the largest religion in Sudan, and Muslims have dominated national government institutions since independence in 1956. According to UNDP Sudan, the Muslim population is 97%, including numerous Arab and non-Arab groups.

"""We will never give up"" says Charlie Hebdo, as it republishes cartoons of Prophet Mohammed which had resulted in a Jihadi terror attack in 2015", 01-Sep-2020,,"The French satirical weekly  “We'll never go to bed. We will never give up”, wrote Charlie Hebdo director Laurent Sourisseau in an editorial which accompanied the controversial cartoons. The daily which includes the cartoons will be available on newsstands on Wednesday but were made available online at noon today. The twelve cartoons, published initially by a Danish daily Jyllands-Posten on September 30, 2005, then by Charlie Hebdo in 2006, showed the prophet carrying a bomb instead of a turban, or as a character armed with a knife flanked by two women veiled in black. In addition to these Danish caricatures, the front page of the next Charlie Hebdo, under the title “Tout ça pour ça”, also included a caricature of the prophet signed by the cartoonist Cabu, who was killed in the attack of January 7, 2015. “We have often been asked since January 2015 to produce other caricatures of Muhammad. We have always refused to do so, not that it is prohibited, the law allows us to do so, but because there was a need for a good reason to do it, a reason which has meaning and which brings something to the debate"", explained the editorial team in the same issue. ""To reproduce the caricatures this week at the opening of the trial of the January 2015 attacks seemed very essential to us,"" adds the Charlie Hebdo team. January 2015 Attack On 7 January 2015, two Islamist gunmen forced their way into the Paris headquarters of Charlie Hebdo and opened fire, killing twelve of its staff including cartoonists Charb, Cabu, Honoré, Tignous and Wolinski, economist Bernard Maris, editors Elsa Cayat and Mustapha Ourrad, guest Michel Renaud, maintenance worker Frédéric Boisseau and police officers Brinsolaro and Merabet, and wounding eleven. During the attack, the gunmen shouted ""Allahu akbar"" and also ""the Prophet is avenged"". President François Hollande had described it as a ""terrorist attack of the most extreme barbarity"".

"Riot breaks out in Sweden after 'anti-Islamic actions'; Swedish town Malmo rocked by stone pelting, violence and vandalism", 29-Aug-2020,,"Sweden witnessed a series of riots on Friday evening as hundreds of Muslims gathered in the southern Swedish town Malmo and unleashed violence. About 300 people took to the streets of Malmo in Sweden and resorted to stone pelting and vandalism late on Friday, hours after an anti-Muslim Danish politician was blocked from attending a Koran-burning rally nearby. The riotets threw stones at police and burned tyres in southern Sweden late on Friday, the police said. The demonstration was connected to an incident earlier in the day in which protesters burned a copy of the Islamic holy book, police spokesman Rickard Lundqvist told Swedish tabloid Expressen. Rasmus Paludan, a Danish political leader, was due to travel to Malmo to speak at that event. He was denied entry in Sweden to have a meeting in Malmo, according to some international media reports while others said he was detained ahead of a planned meeting in the town. ""We suspect that he was going to break the law in Sweden,"" Calle Persson, spokesman for the police in Malmo told AFP. ""There was also a risk that his behaviour... would pose a threat to society."" However, his supporters went ahead with the rally, and three people were then arrested for 'inciting racial hatred'. Later Paludan took to Facebook and posted a scathing message in response to the action taken by the authorities. ""Sent back and banned from Sweden for two years. However, rapists and murderers are always welcome!"" he wrote.

Japan calls for increased cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region to counter Chinese expansion, 10-Sep-2020,,"Japanese Defence Minister Taro Kono has called for increased cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region to counter Chinese expansion. Speaking at a webinar held by Washington-based Center for Strategic & International Studies in Tokyo, Kono pitched for a larger regional mechanism or global mechanism to counter China. Indo-Pacific region is largely viewed as an area comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea. China's territorial claims in the South China Sea its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims in the South China Sea.

Cow Slaughter to be completely banned in Sri Lanka; Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa's proposal receives unanimous support from the ruling party, 11-Sep-2020,,"A proposal to completely ban slaughtering of cows in Sri Lanka has been approved by the parliamentary group of the ruling party, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People’s Front). On 8 September, 2020, Prime Minister Mahindra Rajapaksa made the proposal while addressing the party’s parliamentary group meeting to discuss the agenda for the week. The entire cabinet unanimously accepted the PM's proposal, said Cabinet spokesman and Minister of Mass Media Keheliya Rambukwella while addressing the press. Talking about the proposal, the Sri Lankan PM said that the proposal was quite old and existed since the time of Buddhist Nationalist leader Anagarika Dharmapala but no government was able to legislate against it. The Sri Lankan PM also made a proposal to import beef from other countries instead of butchering cows for beef within the country so as to take care of the meat requirements of some of its citizens. Cabinet spokesman informed that his proposal has been approved by the parliamentary group and the proposal was made by the PM in his capacity as the Minister of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs. Buddhists constitute 70% of Sri Lanka’s population and most Buddhists do not eat beef, as they consider cows sacred. Buddhism enjoys preeminence even in Sri Lanka’s constitution, which states that “it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana” while ensuring freedom of religion as a fundamental right. However, The Animal Act of Sri Lanka which exists today prohibits slaughtering of cows and cow-calves but allows the same in certain cases when it is certified by an appropriate authority. The section of the Sri Lankan Animal Act covering the issue says: 2. Slaughter of cows and cow-calves prohibited. (1) No person shall slaughter, or cause or permit to be slaughtered, any cow (other than a cow imported for slaughter) unless that cow is certified by the appropriate authority to be— (A) Not less than twelve years of age, or (B) Incapable of breeding, or (C) Unfit to be used for any agricultural purpose, and except in accordance with such regulations as may be in force under this Act relating to the slaughter of cows. However, the present proposal by the PM ensures that no slaughter of cows happen under any circumstances. Timeline of ban on cow slaughter  in Sri Lanka In 2009, the Animal Act was amended where in some exceptional cases, slaughter cows was allowed in Sri Lanka. In the same year, a Private Member's bill on total prohibiting the slaughter of cattle (cow) was given to the Speaker of the Sri Lankan House. Wijedasa Rajapaksha, the sponsor of the bill and a ruling party member, argued that killing cattle in Sri Lanka is a breach of the precepts of Buddhism. If enacted, the legislation would criminalise the slaughter of cattle, the sale of the flesh of any cattle slaughtered in Sri Lanka, and aiding someone else in such slaughter or sale. He had also said that slaughter of cattle was one of the main reasons for the decline of the country’s agriculture and dairy industries. He said that 90 percent of the slaughter of cattle was “done on fake licences obtained through bribes”, and that cattle-theft was a big problem. “In the Gampaha district alone about 300 head of cattle are stolen every month,” he had said. In 2013, Wijedasa Rajapaksha's private member bill could not become a law  but the demand or protest to completely stop on cow slaughter started increasing. In the same year, a Buddhist Monk Bowatte Indraratna, committed self-immolation to protest against the practice of cow slaughter. He died after a few days of setting himself on fire near the famous Temple of Buddha's Tooth Relic in the central town of Kandy. Since then, all political parties in Sri Lanka are demanding a ban on cattle, especially cow slaughter in the country. In 2015, Former Sri Lankan government minister Mervyn Silva and Buddhist monks called for the government to bring in laws to ban the slaughter of cattle. Many Buddhist and Hindu groups had joined the demand through protests and seminars on the issue. In 2018, A Hindu group called ‘Seva Senai’, based in northern Sri Lanka, staged a protest in Jaffna, calling for a ban on cow slaughter and the sale of beef in the town of Chavakachcheri.  “This is the land of Hindus and Buddhists. We worship the cow. Our tradition must be respected,” they had demanded.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/11/Cow-Slaughter-to-be-completely-banned-in-Sri-Lanka.html
"For this Bhagyanagar’s resident, Rama Bhakti is the cornerstone of his life", 05-Aug-2020,,"59-year old Ramrao Vitthalrao Sherikar from Bhagyanagar in Telangana, had vowed not to wear any footwear until a grand Ram mandir is built in Ayodhya and a statue of Chattrapati Sivaji Maharaj is erected in Bhagyanagar’s Puranapul area. VSK Telangana, August5, 2020: The struggle for Ayodhya Shri Ram Mandir proves that if human will and determination are strong, divine blessings would always follow. The 500-year old struggle and sacrifices of Hindus has finally borne fruit; thousands have given the supreme sacrifice of their lives and crores of devotees have offered Pujas and Deekshas, many have performed fasting and upavasa deekshas to pray for their dream of Sriram Mandir to come true. The Deeksha of Telangana’s Bhagyanagar (Hyderabad) resident, 59-year old Ramrao Vitthalrao Sherikar, a tea-seller by profession, shows that fervent steadfast devotion is the cornerstone of his life. His family hails from Bidar and has settled in the city for 45 years.  He is devoted to Ayodhya Sriramachandra Murthy and Pune’s Matha Tuljabhavani, he frequently visits Tuljabhavani temple for fulfillment of his wishes.   However his prayers are not for his business or personal riches. His devotion is for a magnificent solemn Sriram temple in Rama’s birthplace Ayodhya. His second wish was for establishing Chattrapati Sivaji Maharaj statue in Bhagyanagar’s  Puranapul area (Gowliguda), and he vowed that he would go without chappals or footwear till both his prayers were fulfilled. Ramrao narrates his experience. In the year 1990, then a newly married Ramrao set out for Ayodhya on the call of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, after convincing his family that he is going on a divine mission for Bhagwan Srirama and that they shouldn’t regret if anything happens to him. His team was arrested as soon as they stepped foot in Uttar Pradesh. Somehow some of them managed to escape from police and chanting Srirama’s name, they walked on foot for 20 days to reach Ayodhya. On their way through several villages, ordinary people provided them food, water and other amenities. None demanded any payment for providing food. The then Mulayam Singh Govt in UP which boasted that they “won’t even allow a single bird to fly across to Ayodhya”, and had taken all measures to lock-in the holy town, was stunned to see thousands of Karsevaks suddenly appearing in Ayodhya. The UP Govt ruthlessly fired upon thousands of unarmed Karsevaks. Ramrao painfully recollects that several localities like Lal bungalow have reddened with the blood of Karsevaks. Somehow, the few who managed to survive that day, reached Delhi despite tremendous difficulties, participated in a protest meeting and then returned to Bhagyanagar. He recalled that only two members from their team managed to stay together throughout the protest, and all others got scattered after police brutalities. Within two years of his return, Ramrao managed to complete the construction and establishment of the Sivaji Maharaj statue. He joyfully went to Tuljabhavani matha temple and started wearing chappals, forgetting his vow of the Ayodhya Srirama temple. Within a short time, he developed unbearable pain and cracks in his legs, no doctor was able to treat his condition.  Matha Tuljabhavani herself appeared in his dream one night and reminded him of his vow for construction of Ayodhya Sriram temple, and directed him to continue his Deeksha. As per Matha’s directions, when he stopped wearing chappals, the pain in his legs disappeared miraculously. Ramrao is overjoyed that today, 5th August 2020, the karsevaks’ devotion and sacrifices as well as crores of Srirama’s devotees' prayers have been answered.

Conspiracy behind observation of Indigenous Peoples' Day in India, 09-Aug-2020,,"All communities in Bharat are its Indigenous Peoples and the question does not arise to give a special benefit to a section of society on the pretext of World Indigenous Peoples' Day. When all Indians have commonly inherited and shared their legacy, the church and missionaries are only instigating selected communities for their own nefarious agenda.  - Ramesh Babu Janjatis of Bharat do not fit the UN’s definition of ‘Indigenous People’ as every community is part and parcel of the land Observation of Indigenous Peoples' Day on 9th August is started world wide following its declaration by UNO in 1994. The significance of the day is to commemorate the first meeting of the UN Working Group on Indigenous Population(UNWGIP)  which was held on 9th August 1982. But, on the same date in 1610 in the history of American continent, a Powhatan tragedy was occurred where 75 indigenous people belonging to the Paspahegh community of Virginia had been butchered by British. There is nothing wrong if anyone thinks that the same day has been chosen as Indigenous Peoples Day, just to pacify the damage done to the Indigenous People. Powhatan's  was not a single incident, in which the Indigenous People had to confront the brutality from colonialist  forces. There were several such incidents and lakhs of indigenous Peoples have been eliminated world over. We have seen such atrocities in the continents like Africa, Asia, America and Australia and colonial forces succeeded in tightening their grip over indigenous peoples in almost all countries barring a few. Indians have thrown out the colonial regime from its soil by taking on them with both revolutionary and non-violent forms of struggle. What the UN has proposed was a welcome step. It may bring some relief to the centuries old sufferings of indigenous communities of those countries. Surely the Indigenous People of these Nations have undergone  inhuman atrocities and sufferings. They were denied a dignified life in their native lands. UN Declaration-2007 is the most comprehensive international instrument on the rights of the Indigenous Peoples. It embodies global consensus on the rights of the Indigenous Peoples and establishes a universal framework of minimum standards for their survival, dignity and well being. It elaborates on existing human rights standards and fundamental freedom, as they apply to the specific situation of Indigenous Peoples. But the same UN Declaration, however, failed to give appropriate definition to the term 'Indigenous Peoples'. The resolution barely claims that the identification of these peoples could be done on the basis of many historical factors. But, the identification can't be done basing on a single yardstick, as the historical experiences across the globe never remained the same. The UN has failed to give appropriate definition to the term 'Indigenous Peoples' as identification can't be done on the basis of a single yardstick, as the historical experiences across the globe never remained the same.  The International Labour Organisation (ILO) in its 169th Convention adopted an international treaty in 1989. Rights under this treaty are based on respect for the cultures and ways of life of Indigenous Peoples. It gives them their right to land and natural resources and define their own priorities for development. Convention aimed at overcoming discriminatory practices affecting these people and enabling them to participate in decision making that affects their life. It is unfortunate that some anti-national and mischievous elements which have a proselytising agenda took IPD as a tool to achieve their objectives by bringing division in the Indian Society. They termed the day as ‘World Adivasi Day’ by manipulating the stand taken by our  government about the issue. The official stand of Bharat on the issue of Indigenous People is that everyone who lives in  Bharat, whether he is a tribal or non tribal are Indigenous Peoples of this land. With a crystal clear approach, our constitution makers have thought to give equal privileges, protections and rights to all its citizens. Special privileges and provisions have been given to uplift those people who are lagging behind due to political, social and economic reasons by bringing such communities under a separate schedule in 1950, way ahead of the UN Declaration in 2007. Since all communities in Bharat are its Indigenous Peoples, the question does not arise to give a special benefit to a section of society in the pretext of World Indigenous Peoples' Day,  when all Indians have commonly inherited and shared their legacy. Here the church and missionaries are insisting the scheduled Tribe People to observe and celebrate the day as World Adivasi Day. As far as the day (9th August) is concerned the day has no relevance in the Indian context. If at all the day has to be observed, it should be observed as a day of mourning  for the World Indigenous People for the reason I have mentioned in the beginning of this article. Whatever has been mentioned in the UN Declaration-2007 about the indigenous peoples is seen in the western countries. We expressed our solidarity with those who have been oppressed there and their grievances and the concerns should be addressed by the respective governments. Numerous Janjatis and their leaders like Rani Gaidinliu, Tirot Sing, Alluri Sitarama Raju, Surendra Sai, Birsa Munda, Pazhassi raja have fought the colonial forces as Bharatiyas But nothing from the UN Declaration in this regard is applicable to our country, as Bharat as whole is inhabited by its Indigenous Peoples. The constitution has taken all measures to protect all the rights, barring one or two articles of the UN Charter of 46 articles. Among them the ‘right to self-determination’ is the most vicious one. When our representative signs in support of the charter he has made a clear mention about the clause 'right to self-determination'  as it is  against the unity and integrity of our nation and it poses a threat to its sovereignty.  The right to self-determination that adds itself as a culmination of these conventions stand as a misnomer in the context of India where the democratic rights of the people have safeguarded through various means. Even the elite -educated class and people in the media are not aware of these facts and they gave little notice to the matter. There are certain agencies in India which are trying to ruin the tribal culture, identity, beliefs and values. They are engaged in proselytising activities. Stern action should be taken to curb the religious conversion. They have been trying to cultivate Aryan Invasion Theory(AIT) to attract the Janjati people that only the Janjatis are the Indigenous Peoples of this land and they have been pushed into the forest  by the Aryans. Similarly it is also being argued even in the absence of evidence that the Dravidians also were chased upto the southern seashore by the Aryans. But the recent excavations in the Rakhigarhi of Harappa region has demolished the AIT that there was no trace of any invasion taking place in the region. Archaeological evidence, genetic evidence, timeline and anthropological evidence have disapproved the theory. There is nothing to say about an invasion that never was. Janjati people were the pioneers in the struggle against the British.Numerous Janjatis and their leaders like Rani Gaidinliu, Tirot Sing, Alluri Sitarama Raju, Surendra Sai, Birsa Munda, Pazhassi raja have fought the colonial forces as Bharatiyas.  Janjati people can have a separate day that can bring pride and self respect in each and every Indian. Janjati people were the pioneers in the struggle against the British. You can see a Thalakkal Chandu along with Pazhassi Raja in his fight against East India Company. Thalakkal Chandu was hanged in 1805. There are many such examples in the length and breadth of the country. They have shown their fighting spirit against not only British, but against the Mughals too. They have fought against Mughals along with Rana Pratap and Shivaji.  The story of Rani Durgavati of Jabalpur was another example of the fight of Janjati people against Mughals. You will find many names such as Tilka Majhi, Neelambar, Pitambar, Sidhu, Kanu, Alluri Sitaram Raju, Govind Guru, Veer Narayan, Shambhu Dhanu Phunglosa, Jadonong, Rani Gaidinliu, Rani Ruipuiliani, Mutmor Jomoh etc. Birsa Munda is the most renowned and widely revered revolutionary leader who had bravely fought simultaneously against British Officers and the Missionaries engaged in religious conversion. He realised the fact that both the British officers and the Missionaries have ‘the same hat',  the hat that worn by a British officer and an evangelist are the same. That means their objectives are the same. Over the years, the revolutionary spirit shown by Birsa Munda has earned him the status of an  Icon of Janjati People of Bharat. Why can't we project the birth anniversary of Birsa Munda (15 November) as a day of our pride (Gourav Divas). We can celebrate the day with much enthusiasm. And also we will have to see that the tribal rights are well protected under our constitutional framework. We have to see that the constitutional provisions and protective measures of Janjati people are implemented properly.  Panchayati Raj Extension into Scheduled Areas(PESA) and Forest Right Act(2006) will prove to be the game changer in the Scheduled Areas in India in the days to come.  9th August has nothing to do with India. Whatever we could do the most on that day is just expressing solidarity with Indigenous Peoples of western countries for their fight to ensure their right.

"Education reforms is all about what we teach and not how we teach: Dr. Anand Ranganathan, JNU Professor at #MyBharat lecture series", 11-Aug-2020,- VSK Karnataka,"Dr. Anand Ranganathan, Professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University(JNU), New Delhi spoke on educational reforms at Disha Bharat’s 15-day lecture series on the occasion of 74th Indian Independence day. Dr. Anand stressed what we teach students hold more value and carries weight than how we teach. He said throughout the system where we have been  teaching, the focus has been on the ways of teaching; without bringing out facts on the table, igniting the intellect of the students gets Herculean. He expressed that the multiple educational reforms so far made have not made anyone proud. Speaking about the recent Union Cabinet approved National Education Policy, he said the vocational training introduced is a welcome move but care needs to be taken on teaching. Any education without changing the syllabus by an iota would not radically better the education he said. Though there have been politicians who realised ‘what was being taught’ had to change, a strong determination to modify accordingly never happened. The sad part of the education that science and mathematics which originated in Bharat was purposefully omitted due to politics Dr. Anand opined. Prof Brhamachari, or Ram Nath Chopra, Azizul Haque , Hem Chandra Bose, or G N Ramachandran are names which we should remember, while no schools teach about them the speaker said. A conscious attempt to hide the achievements of Indian scientists by our own system has been established and clearly it is the politics which has to be blamed Dr. Anand complained. The story is not just around the science and mathematics. The actual history of Bharat also is not taught and selectively hiding few aspects of a person or event would not benefit the students he argued. The judgement to shaping of the minds of the young children cannot be achieved by such selectivity he said. The teaching of religion, for that matter atheism, kings of the previous era, science needs to be updated so that the decision could be left to the students to pick the right aspect. Teaching students about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore and not quoting him on his views of religion of Christianity and Islam or teaching Dr. B R Ambedkar and not providing his view of Islam being “brotherhood of Muslims to Muslims only” will not provide the truth to the learner and such teachings leads only to a one sided view. Dr. Anand quoted former American President  Ronald Regan on Karl Marx ,”Communist is someone who reads Marx and Lenin. An anti-Communist is someone who understands Marx and Lenin.” He urged the killings of the Communists and they hailing the Tienanmen Square Massacre and yet speaking about human rights needs to be exposed. Be it Che Guevara or Akbar or Aurangzeb or Tipu Sultan the need of the hour is to portray the full picture of them and not provide a one sided view to the students which only leads to confusion he added. Dr. B R Ambedkar’s reasoning to convert to Buddhism and not Islam or Christianity was the fear he had that the depressed classes would be denationalised and sadly such notes are never taught in schools he concluded.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/11/Education-reforms-is-all-about-what-we-teach-and-not-how-we-teach-Dr-Anand-Ranganathan.html

Indigenous Peoples Day: A Deceptive tool in the hands of anti-India forces to divide Indians, 09-Aug-2020,-By Sharad Chavan,"Taking advantage of ingenuity of our indigenous people, their lack of modern education, their living in a commune and by playing with their ethos and emotions, certain ideological groups with malicious intent, some organizations working against the unity and integrity of India and the machinery wanting to divide the society on the basis of various castes, sects etc. are planning to celebrate 9th August 2020 as “International Indigenous Day”. India has an age old tradition of celebrations and festivals. In the independent India, festivals and celebrations got segregated on the basis of religion and social divisions. Government directive made it mandatory to celebrate certain days viz. birth anniversaries, death anniversaries and historically significant days. Of those mandatory celebrations, some are celebrated out of compulsion and some are celebrated with fervor under the pretext of establishing a pseudo identity. Some festive days were introduced because of globalization and were motivated by commercial profit making, these included especially those appealing to the emotions of youth/college students like Rose Day, Friendship Day, Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, etc. These days were given undue importance and were celebrated by the youth on college campuses, initially with a creative spirit which eventually took a rather indecent turn. One can understand the spirit of celebrations of such special Days- religious, social or for commercial profit making and generally one need not oppose them. However if such celebrations of the so-called international Days, including the ones even proposed by UNO, are against our national integrity, sovereignty or if they are inconsistent with our traditions, one should be aware of the ploy behind introducing such celebrations prior to following them in India. Taking advantage of ingenuity of our indigenous people, their lack of modern education, their living in a commune and by playing with their ethos and emotions, certain ideological groups with malicious intent, some organizations working against the unity and integrity of India and the machinery wanting to divide the society on the basis of various castes, sects etc. are planning to celebrate 9th August 2020 as “International Indigenous Day”. As a part of an international ploy they are encouraging the tribal youth to celebrate this day with vigor. They are nudging them to celebrate by offering them to help in various ways. Their arguments are: 1. Population of indigenous people in the world is around 44 crore of which about 11 crore is in India. So one thought behind this celebration is that indigenous people of India should lead this international day. 2. One thought that is being imbibed in the minds of the tribals is that - those who are not letting us celebrate our day of honor are enemies of indigenous people and that these very outsiders, invaders are responsible for our conditions today. 3. We are the aboriginal residents of this land. We are the owners of this land. Since we are residing here since ages we have the right over this land, right to question them, right to drive them out. This is the day of driving the invaders out and becoming kings of our land again. This is the day of our honor that is International Indigenous Day- 9th August. 4. Not only the common man but ministries for tribal affairs of various state governments including that of Maharashtra are impressed with this spurious idea and they have issued circulars in their respective states instructing to celebrate this day. What is the real idea behind this day? Is there any relation between India and this international day celebrations? It is important to understand the facts about: who started this International Day (celebrations)? And why was it started? In 1990 the World Human Rights commission became active and became more aware about world population, the current status of people, their lives and their fundamental rights. Keeping these points in focus, various surveys were conducted, conferences were held. In 1992 UNESCO passed one resolution in a meeting held in Geneva, taking into consideration the current status of aboriginal people, indigenous people of the world. This resolution consists of 45 clauses/points. It is divided into eight parts. There was no correlation between India and the points considered while passing this resolution. While signing the resolution it was made clear by the delegation of Government of India at that point of time that there was no relation between the points mentioned and the conditions in India. They said: We are signing this considering the broader wellbeing of the international community. However we make it clear that “All the residents of India (barring Christian, Muslims, Jews, Parsis and other invaders) are the original residents of India.” Invaders who came to India hailed from outside countries and they deprived the natives of their rights. They enslaved them, forced them to flee to various mountain regions. Eventually all the natives fought with the invaders and got back their independence. While establishing colonies elsewhere in the world they used the modus operandi used by them during European conquest. British succeeded in imposing their wellcrafted, researched theories upon India that Aryans were outsiders, they invaded non Aryans, destroyed their religion, culture and occupied their land. At the time of passing this resolution India opposed all these points and placed its point of view very clearly across the table. The main point of this resolution was that while establishing their rule in many countries across the world. European nations- especially Spain, Portugal, France, Britain- enslaved the natives of those countries, committed atrocities on them, forced religious conversions thus forcing them to live a miserable life. They took away their independence, deprived them of their right to live and that all their privileges were taken away. Their life was confined to a limited area. As slaves, the natives were intimidated, forced to do laborious jobs. This was going on in various parts of the world for about 500 years. 9th August is in no way a day of glorifying the indigenous people of the world nor does it have any historical background. Many indigenous population have started opposing the celebration recommended by UNO. In many countries, there is a strong opposition to celebration on this day. Europeans conquered many countries in a short span. Even though in India the British ruled for about 150 years, right from the day they stepped in till they left, they had to face opposition from people. The opposition was with modern weapons as well as by means of language, through the governing machinery and in many democratic ways. Secondly, along with the European army, their fourth army i.e. the missionaries, also created a havoc in the world. Army killed many residents and the survived ones were converted to Christianity by the missionaries. In spite of ruling over India, the British were not successful in converting the community to Christianity. Those who didn’t convert to either Christianity or to Islam they were displaced in their own land or had to live in fear somewhere hiding in hills. Those who did not accept the imposed culture, cruelty and those who preferred to keep their own traditions were forced to live life like aboriginal people. After 1947, many countries, including India got their independence. Countries existing as British colonies were liberated. It was a shock to the British colonists who thought that the sun will never set on their empire. Their dream of ruling the world for longer time was shattered and India had played a major role in it. Recognising the fact that India can be the next super power in the world, British started playing the indigenous people card and the nations which were opponents of India joined in. The definitions of Indigenous people consider all points listed above. Some regions can be identified as ones inhabited by aboriginal tribes for example, French-Somalia, British-Somalia, French Guyana, Dutch-Guyana, Red Indians in America, Native Australians, Papua, Mawri. These communities inhabited these territories since beginning. India does not figure in any such category. Ancient cultures like Mayan, Inca became extinct from the world map. Towards the end of 21st century, problems of aboriginal people came to fore through discussions on various forums facilitated by UNO. The year 1993 was celebrated as International Year of Indigenous People. It was also decided to celebrate the decade from 1995-2004 as the International Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples. It was with an intention to develop a communication method to aid the development of indigenous people, showcasing their arts, culture and lifestyle using various media, grant them their right to live, nurture their unique way of life, assure them their normal life, their integrity, safety. It was to vouch that there will be no violence or genocide against them, recognize their right to live as a private citizen or as a community, right for proclaiming their identity as Indigenous people, protecting their fundamental rights even in the situations of emergency or war. Rights of indigenous people regarding their culture, spiritual beliefs, and languages have already been recognized. Their right to nurture their history, traditions, languages, use of dialects, scripts, their community names and places, right to education, traditional knowledge, and information have also been recognized. Such points were included as part of the agenda during that decade. It is surprising that the world had to wait till 21st century to think about indigenous people whereas India not only thought about her indigenous people but respectfully recognized their fundamental rights in the constitution. It did not stop here. By setting up various commissions and acting upon their recommendations India has passed various acts such as Panchayat Raj act, PESA act, Private forest, community forest acquisition and forest conservation act. While granting these rights to the indigenous people of India, the stand of the Government was very clear, though the indigenous people are living away from modern civilization, living in various mountain regions, forests, they should be granted their rights not as a favor, but they should get it as respected fellow citizens of this country. The unique feature of our nation is that though we have diversity in languages, food, attire and we have different sects, castes etc, still we are united in our culture, faith, belief, history. Our joys and sorrows are same, our allies and foes are same and we share same traditions. We are united as Indians and we have manifested this to the world for years together. We can understand the apathy of the British since they were interested in ruling the country in whatever possible way. Hence they spread many distorted versions of Indian tradition and knowledge systems through the education system and through the Government machinery. One among such ideas was that India never existed as a nation. It was and is just a congregation of various communities. The Aryans were the invaders who came from outside India. They were the ones who kept these communities together. Hence every community has a right to be independent. British claimed that like them Aryans too were outsiders. They succeeded in spreading this hypothesis however failed in convincing the same to all Indians. Unfortunately, in independent India, certain forces emerged which encouraged the differences to grow among people. These comprised the Congress, the Left, Missionaries, the Muslims and several institutions based on caste. Hence one could witness the conflict between various sects, rural and urban population and the tribal conflict. A fictitious concept of identity was created and hatred was inculcated to such levels that there was a denial of Indian culture, history even the Constitution in the college campuses. Events not connected with our culture were celebrated as our festivals e.g. Beef parties, Love for Kissing, Indigenous People Day, Bharat Todo etc. These are attempts to establish a divide at various levels including institutions like JNU. Basically, 9th August is in no way a day of glorifying the indigenous people of the world nor does it have any historical background. Since 2007, 9th August is being celebrated as International Indigenous Day and eventually Tribal Felicitation Day in India. Many indigenous population have started opposing the celebration recommended by UNO. In many countries, there is a strong opposition to celebration on this day. Events like International Yoga Day, Youth Day which were gifted by India to the entire world impart a message of Unity and Positivity. In the celebrations of 9th August one fail to see such a motive being fulfilled. In the decades of 70s and 80s, in the strict Indian context, 9th August was a memory of the ‘Chale Jaav’ movement of 1942. Later on, after the socialists and leftists started controlling the education system, it was called as ‘August Kranti Din’ and then only ‘Kranti Din’. However our nation never believed in their revolution and revolutionaries. Hence taking advantage of the fragmented identity of the indigenous population in India, all the antinational organizations are celebrating 9th August as a part of the conspiracy against India. Hence one can not see any traces of awareness about the rights of the tribals but pronouncing the vitiating differences like Arya/Anarya, touchable/untouchable etc. to serve the vested interests. Unfortunately, many state governments also fell a prey to the propaganda and performed these programs at the government level and thus encourage the division. Encouraging such programs under the pretention of identity of indigenous people may lead to further division of the country. Hence the entire population and the indigenous population need to be watchful. Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram or the NGOs and individuals working for indigenous population are creating awareness in the interest of the nation. Hence, although this day finds a place on the world map, it will not be successful as a conspiracy at any cost.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/9/Indigenous-Peoples-Day-a-Deceptive-tool-in-the-hands-of-anti-India-forces-to-divide-Indians.html
We need to move from 'Global Market' to 'Global Family'; Interdependence should be based on respect for identity and dignity for all: RSS Sarsanghchalak Dr Mohan Bhagwat, 13-Aug-2020,,"""Mutual cooperation among self-reliant countries while considering the world as one family and not one market, seems to be the economic model required for the post-COVID world,"" RSS Sarsanghchalak Dr Mohan Bhagwat said while speaking at a virtual book launch event. ""We will take everything which is good for us from around the world. 'Aano bhadra krtavo yantu vishwatah' (Vedic mantra meaning, Let noble thoughts come to me from all directions). But what we take from outside should be according to our needs,"" he said. Elaborating on the concept of Swadeshi, Shri Mohan Bhagwat said that only those technologies or materials may be imported which the country lacks traditionally or are not available locally. Talking about the relevance of being self-reliant and Swadeshi in the wake of COVID-19, he suggested that the pandemic has made it clear that globalisation did not yield desired results and one economic model cannot be applicable everywhere. Backing the idea of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the RSS Sarsanghchalak said swadeshi means to promote and give preference to indigenous products or technologies and not necessarily boycott all foreign items. For Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliance), Atmabhan (Self-realisation), Atma Vishwas (Self-Confidence) are essential, he added. Citing a few examples when traditionally available products and technologies were overlooked for imported ones, Shri Mohan Bhagwat emphasised on the need for change in mindset and not considering domestic items as inferior. Shri Mohan Bhagwat described the National Education Policy as a ""step in the right direction"" to make India self-reliant, and said that such policies would help India realise the potential of its people and of traditional wisdom. He also said that India's current economic policy focuses on prosperity, he said: ""After independence, we did not implement our economic policy in order to prevent ourselves from suffering losses due to influence from the West and other foreign countries. Following this, many locally available products and technologies were overlooked in favour of foreign items. It is good that now we are progressing in a better direction."" ""We should think with confidence about our comprehensive integral vision, relevant policies and proper implementation to actualise our economic goals,"" he said. Shri Mohan Bhagwat launched books Your Degree is not Enough and Tough Choices & Hard Decisions: Rebuilding India,  authored by Prof Rajendra Pratap Gupta in a virtual book launch ceremony in New Delhi.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/13/RSS-Sarsanghchalak-Dr-Mohan-Bhagwat.html

Atrocities of the Church on Janjatis of India, 22-Aug-2020,- Ramesh Babu,"From Kandhamal to Palghar, the Church in India continues to foster activities to break Hindu society to break India 23rd August is the 13th martyrdom Day of Swami Lakshmananandji Saraswati of Kandhamal, Orissa. Swamiji and 4 others were brutally killed on a day of Janmashtami (23.08.2008) by church sponsored goons. Such acts of violence are being continued by church even today. Let us go to the history of Christian missionaries and associated violence in India. Barring the advent of Syrian Christians in 3rd century A. D, rest of the missionaries were instrumental to European Colonialism. When the Pope settled the dispute and advised both Portuguese and Spanish to explore new heavens in the world, he advised them to carry CROSS along with them to win over continents in the name of Christ. First thing the Portuguese had done after their arrival under the leadership of Vasco De Gama was to evangelise Syrian refugees who had become part and parcel of the culture of Kerala. They introduced the New Testament and forced them to give up the local customs they had already adapted. Syrian Christians were also asked to maintain distance and keep a separate identity. Atrocities committed to the people of Goa by Portuguese are well known to all. Though Pope had pleaded for apology in the continents of Africa and Australia for the genocide the church had done to them, he is yet to make an apology to people of India for the atrocities committed by church in Goa. Later, in the eighteenth century, British, the most formidable Europeans, came here in the name of doing business. Slowly and gradually, they grabbed our princely states one after another and established their imperialism in India. Once they made their grip over India, they brought Christian missionaries, the forth wing of British army to ensure their everlasting rule in India by carrying out humanitarian services with a sole objective of converting the Indians to Christianity. Most astonishing fact is that the decision to send missionaries in India was taken based on the discussion held in the house of commons of British Parliament. Christian atrocities on Indigenous Faith followers continued even after India got independence. Tribal belts of central India were not spared from their conversion drive. Whosoever stood against them was eliminated to clear their path of aggression from any hurdles. Janjati people were the first of all who reacted to this nefarious design of British. In the later part of the 19th century Birsa Munda fought against both British rulers as well as Christian Missionaries simultaneously. The Seng Khasi movement was started to protect the indigenous faith and culture of the Khasi people of Meghalaya from aggressive campaigns of Christian Missionaries. Government jobs in Meghalaya were secured to those who are products of Christian schools. Policy of Government and missionary work acted hand in glow to suit the agenda of religious conversion. Struggles led by Tirot Sing of Khasi hills, Shambhu Dhanu Phunglosa of North Cachar Hills and later by Jadonang and Rani Gaidinliu of Naga Hills and state of Manipur were to stop the high handedness of the British officers and Missionaries. After a rigorous imprisonment of long 15 years when Rani Gaidinliu came back to her native village, she found her people were being converted by insurgents of Naga National Council (NNC) at gunpoint. She was compelled to take up arms once again, but this time against the insurgents who were acting on the behest of Christian Missionaries. Ranima started the Heraka movement to counter the Christian atrocities. All these struggles led by janajati leaders were semi political and semi religious in nature. We could see similar movements in the then Bihar, Orissa and in the region of central Province and Berar. Crown colony plans and secession of Chhota Nagpur region were designed by the British when they found that their days in India are counted. They understood the undercurrent of revolutionary activities as well as the non-violent movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. Crown colony plan was to create a Christian land in Eastern part of India which would remain under the British crown even after British were forced to leave India. However, British had no other option but to quit India. Though they left India they kept their fourth army, the missionaries in India to do further damage to the nation. The Congress Government of Central Province and Berar was the first to react against the foreign missionaries and their anti national role. Pandit Ravishankar Shukla ordered an inquiry into the activities of Christian Missionaries. Justice B.S. Niyogi was appointed as the chairman of the commission to study the matter. Niyogi Commission report brought to light, all the fraudulent means applied by Christian missionaries to convert the innocent, ignorant and simple hearted Janajatis. Many of its recommendations are still relevant. Christian Inquisition set up by Catholic Church to root out Pagan culture has continued even to this day but in different forms Christian atrocities on Indigenous Faith followers continued even after India got independence. It will be out of imagination for all that religious conversions are going on in the northeastern part of India at gun point even today. Tribal belts of central India also were not spared from their conversion drive. Whosoever stood against them was eliminated to clear their path of aggression out of any hurdles. Cold blooded murder of Swami Sada Premanand Saraswati was done on the direction of Christian missionaries in 1992 at Gumargunda Ashram, Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh. He engaged himself in the Service activities of Ashram as well as spiritual discourses. Missionaries found him as a stumbling block to their proselytizing activities.  Similarly, militants engaged by the Baptist Church in Tripura had killed a Prominent Swami Shanti Kali Maharaj of Tripura on 27 August 2000. He too was shot at his own Ashram by armed goons. He was killed for shielding the people of tribal communities in Tripura from missionary activities. Shri. Manik Sarkar, the then Chief Minister of Tripura also admitted the involvement of the Baptist church with the militants in the killing. Birsa Munda fought both British and Christian Missionaries. The Seng Khasi movement was started to protect the indigenous faith and culture of the Khasi people from Christian Missionaries. Another case occurred in Meghalaya. Rijoysing Khongsha was a Seng Khasi leader of Meghalaya who was abducted and gunned down by the militants belonging to Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC). Rijoysing was an enthusiastic social leader who led the people from the front. His increasing activity and popularity had become a headache to Christians in Khasi Hills of Meghalaya. Christian Missionaries engaged the militant outfit to silence him. It abducted and killed Rijoysing in the year 2001. Provocative murder of 80 year old Swami Lakshmanandji Saraswati was the most heinous crime done by missionary sponsored goons on an auspicious day of   Krishna Janmashtami in 2008. Killing swamiji itself is highly condemnable and when it was done on a most significant day of Hindus, the outrage was multiplied. He along with four of his disciples were brutally killed when he was attending the evening prayer. It shows how intolerant are the Christians! Nation should stand united to raise voice against all such violence promoted by the Church against Hindus. The Palghar incident was the latest of all. It was very unfortunate that such an incident had taken place in a janjati village. The incident has shown what would happen to innocent tribals, once they are converted into Christianity. Missionaries and Communist have injected venom of hatred into them. As a result of it, two Sadhus were lynched to death for no reason. The Church is still continuing such activities to break Hindu society to break India. Time has come to once again set up a commission to expose the amount of social ill-feelings and anti national feelings, church has created in the Janjati areas of India.

"""Respect for nature's creation is integral part of Bharatiya lifestyle. We have to adopt it again to save the mankind"" - RSS Sarsanghchalak Dr Mohan Bhagwat", 30-Aug-2020,,"RSS Sarsanghchalak Dr Mohan Bhagwat addressed the 'Prakriti Vandan' program organised by HSSF and IMCTF  in Association with Paryavaran Samrakshan today. In his address Sarsangchalak said that the sustainable lifestlye of Bharat is the way forward for the mankind. The deviation in our lifestyle in the last 300-350 years is the reason for the environmental degradation, he said. ""Indian way has been very different. Our ancestors understood the truth behind our existence in its entirety. Since then they understood that we too are a part of the whole nature. Just like the fact that our body can function only when different parts of the body function. And as long as the body is alive, only then a part of the body can function"", he said in his address. Likening the human body with nature, he said that just as different organs of our body function in unison for us to stay alive, every creature of nature have to function properly for the nature to thrive. ""The body is dependent on the functions of the organs, the organ is dependent on the pranic energy received by the body. This is the same relationship we have with earth. We are a part of it and it is our duty to nurture the creation"", he said. Noting the importance of Hindu traditional festivals like Nag Panchami, Govardhan Puja or Tulsi pooja, Sarsangchalak said that we have to now adopt these to the modern day so that the new generation also learns from them. "" We have to celebrate all these days in today's context and have to revive and reinvent these traditional practices throughout our lives. It is only then that the new generation will learn them and experience them. We too are components of the same nature. We have to get nourishment from nature, not conquer nature. We have to keep nature alive by getting nourishment from nature itself. It is only by adopting this way of life, the next generation will follow and only then will we be able to overcome the deviation that has occured in the last 300-350 years during the next 100-200 years. The world will be safe, mankind will be safe and life will be beautiful"", he said. Urging people to bring about gradual changes  for a sustanable lifestlye, he said that thinking about nature should not be a single day's affair. ""While celebrating this day, we have to be aware that we are not merely indulging in some entertainment program, but to nurture the whole creation, to make our life beautiful, and for the advancement of all. I think that we should think with an open mind and implement the message of this day by bringing about small changes in our lifestyles and implement it each day throughout the year"", eh said in his address. The Hindu Spiritual and Service Foundation [HSSF] and Initiative For Moral and Cultural Foundation [IMCTF] today 'Prakriti Vandan' is being organised to create a sustainable Environment so that humans live in harmony with Nature. Living in harmony has been an integral and unique part of our Bharatiya culture and tradition. This has been abundantly reflected in a variety of traditional practices, religious beliefs, rituals, folklore, arts & crafts, and in the daily lives of the Bharatiya people from time immemorial.

Let our Children Learn Sanskrit, 31-Aug-2020,- G Nataraja Perumal,"In 2019, Uttarakhand government made Sanskrit mandatory for all schools in the state (HT Photo) The National Education Policy of the union Govt at the centre has made it clear that Sanskrit would be introduced right from School Education up to university level and it would definitely find favor, with those who are interested in the cultural, spiritual and traditional integrity of the nation. But at the same time the choice has been left to the states revealing the flexibility of the policy. Uttarakhand has announced Sanskrit as the second language in 2019 itself. Himachal Pradesh has announced the same a few days before.The union territory of Pondicherry has at least decided to express its stand on the third language option after due deliberations.There is a distinct possibility of many states opting for the ancient language as third option. But Tamil Nadu is the one and the only exception where an aversion to both Sanskrit and Hindi has been systematically built up with a view to wean the people from the mainstream. Sanskrit is depicted as an enemy of Tamil. The purpose of this write up is to break the myth that shrouds Sanskrit due to false propaganda and indoctrination. Sanskrit is the mother of all languages. It has the highest number of sounds (aksharas) or phonemes, as many as 51. An ancient language, it is the root of our rich religious culture and tradition. Invariably, all our scriptures, including Upanishads, Brahma sutra, Geetha Yoga sutra, Yoga vasistha, Ramayana, Mahabaratha, and Srimad Bagavatham are all in Sanskrit and so are our Ayurvedic treatises like Sarak Samhitha ,Sushruta samhita and Rasa Tantra. To know Sanskrit is to know our Sanathana Dharma in all its entirety, nothing more ,nothing less. Sanskrit is the epitome/repository of our indigenous knowledge system which includes Astronomy Astrology, Arithmetic and so on. This majestic and benign language is at once ancient and modern. Many physicists have found this language quite suitable as a digital language for sophisticated computer operations notations and derivations associated with Artificial intelligence (AI). Many slokas of Sanskrit have been encoded with mathematical formulae by a peculiar system of notation known as Kattappa Yathi sankaya. The exact date, month and year of composition of Narayaneeyam is incorporated in the slokas by this method. Vedic Mathematics is a science in it self. Value of pi to its 31th place is to be found in another Krishna sloka. It would be very much in order if I mention an interesting incident that occurred in the life of Albert Einstein. Once an Indian Scholar by name Dr. B.N Gupta visited the great scientist of Theory of Relativity fame. Einstein greeted the Scholar in Sanskrit. The Indian scholar pleaded his ignorance. Then Einstein said, 'you have come from India, the land of Sanskrit and yet you have not cared to learn the great language'. He then appealed to the scholar to visit his library, which treasured valuable gems of Sanskrit like Bagavad Gita and Upanishads. The noble scientist also added that these immortal scriptures form the basis of his research. It is needless to say the Indian scientist hung his head in utter shame and disgust. A prophet is not honored in his place of birth is quite true of Sanskrit. To its credit, Sanskrit words are to be found in all great literary works all over the world. The immortal Tamil work Thirukural has at least 8% of Sanskrit words and the famous tantric literature Thirumanthiram, which forms the foundation for Saiva Siddhanta, though next only to Sivagnabotham, is not way behind with as high as 12% of Sanskrit terminology. Even in our day to day life we freely use such words as suriyan (sun), karunai (compassion), which are Sanskrit to the core.And the common people have no aversion to use them.Truth to be told, many a Krishnan won't like him to be addressed as 'kritinan', in chaste Tamil. Doing away with one or two Sanskrit phonemes robes the whole word of its musical and magical charm.  The immortal Tamil work Thirukural has at least 8% of Sanskrit words and the famous tantric literature Thirumanthiram, which forms the foundation for Saiva Siddhanta, though next only to Sivagnabotham, is not way behind with as high as 12% of Sanskrit terminology.  The saints of the yore, in all their wisdom, make a good compromise between these two ancient languages by a beautiful analogy. When Lord Siva turned His drum Tamil issued forth from one side of it and Sanskrit from the reverse. What an attempt at reconciliation, unification, synthesis and harmony. Both the languages have many lofty concepts in common. The oft repeated Tamilian idea of universal brotherhood, ‘onrae kulam, oruvanae devan’ sourced in Thirumanthiram is the same as the vedic concept of ‘Vasudeivaha kudubaham’ (the whole universe is one family). Kanian Poonkunranar of Purananuru fame had the same cosmic stand even at an earlier age, when he versed thus: 'yaathum oore yavarum kalzeer' meaning, every place is verily ours and every one our own kith and kin. It is not without reason that Max Muller translated Upanishads into English. Oppenheimer, the Atomic scientist, drew a parallel between the Bhagavad Gita and the first atomic explosion, especially its effulgence born of split, quoting verses from the Githa. Mahatma Gandhi observed that every Hindu boy and Girl should posses a sound knowledge of Sanskrit and that without the study of Sanskrit one can't become a true Indian and a true learned man. Asked as to why he is one among those who sponsored Sanskrit as the official language of the union, Dr. Ambedkar retorted: what is wrong with Sanskrit? Many may not know that a village in Karnataka by name Mattur in Shimoga district uses Sanskrit as a spoken language. While the influence of Hindi is restricted to Hindi heartland, the influence of Sanskrit is far and wide and felt in all Indo-European languages, not to speak of Hindi. The members of Indian intelligentsia, who oppose Sanskrit tooth and nail, are of the same wavelength of Lord Macaulay who are still carrying out Macaulay’s mission of depriving Indians of their Indianness, in full measure. Moreover it is for parents and children to decide the choice of language. Let the vernacular be the medium of instruction and it must be. Nowadays one could find children especially the elite ones hailing from the families of politicians and bureaucrats learn not only Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit Spanish and what not. Cosmopolitanism, in view of better prospects, for their own children and ‘frog in the well’ policy for the man on the road. The state has already lost rural oriented Navodaya Schools in the past due to shortsightedness. Let our children learn a new language (Sanskrit) and let not our netas stand as a stumbling block in their way.

"Bhartiya Shiksha Samiti organises “Prakriti Vandan” at 6000 different locations across J&K, Ladakh; pledges to conserve Mother Nature", 31-Aug-2020,,"Jammu: A large number of teachers, students and people from civil society today became the part of “Prakriti Vandan” program by worshiping the trees and plants at their homes; and pledged to protect them in order to conserve nature. The event was jointly organized by Bhartiya Shiksha Samiti (BSS), J&K, Hindu Spiritual Service Foundation and Environment Conservation Activity. Under this program, 8750 persons had done online registration through the medium of 36 schools working under Bhartiya Shiksha Samiti in J&K and Ladakh. They pledged to work for the conservation of nature by protecting the trees and plants around them. Today, at 10 a.m, all the family members worshiped the trees and plants in their home in a traditional manner. They even tied sacred thread around the trees and vowed to protect them. On the occasion, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat held a virtual dialogue with millions of people on conservation of the environment, forest, water and land. The people from Kishtwar, Doda, Bhaderwah, Rajouri, Ramban, Udhampur, Reasi, Samba and Kathua; and Zanskar and Leh in Ladakh UT enthusiastically participated in the program. The program was organized at 6000 different locations. Shri Pradeep ji, Organizing Secretary, Bhartiya Shiksha Samiti J&K, urged the people to renounce the spirit of conquering nature.  He said that we are also a part of nature, this thing has to be understood.  “Environment, this word is heard a lot these days, it is also said and there is a program to celebrate it one day. The reason for this is that the way of living in the world so far is not according to the environment, it is believed that by winning nature, that way is to live by humans. We have been living like this for the last two and a half hundred years. His ill effects are now coming in front of us. His horrors are now visible. If it continues like this, then we will not be there to live life in the universe. It can also happen that the world does not exist. And so the man started thinking now, he thought that the environment should be protected,” he further said. President of BSS J&K, Shri Ved Bhushan expressed gratitude to all the volunteers for the success of this program and vowed to continue the struggle for the cause of nature conservation.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/31/Bhartiya-Shiksha-Samiti-organises-Prakriti-Vandan-in-JK-and-Ladakh.html
Vivekananda Rock Memorial - A Living Memorial, 02-Sep-2020,- Nikhil Yadav,"Celebrating its 50th year, the Vivekananda Kendra initiated the ""Ek Bharat, Vijayi Bharat"" connectivity campaign by meeting the President and Prime Minister of India ,through this connectivity campaign the volunteers  of  Vivekananda Kendra will contact thousands of people from different sections of the society and inspire them by ""giving  the message of Swami Vivekananda as well as motivating them to contribute for the welfare and promotion of the society.""                   One of the magnificent traditional architectural marvels of modern India is the Rock Memorial of Swami Vivekananda. The memorial marks its fiftieth anniversary since its erection and inauguration, on 2nd September 2020. In India there are thousands of beautiful monuments – beautiful structures whose presence tells tales of our history. They articulate our national memories - ancient and more recent .But hardly any is as bustling and full of life as the Rock Memorial.  The structure was dedicated to the nation in the year 1970, and it keeps Swami Vivekananda's ideas and teachings alive in the national memory. After two years of long travel across the sacred land of Bharat, Swami Vivekananda reached Kanyakumari and after doing  ‘Sadhana’ on the rock (present day Vivekananda Rock Memorial ) situated at Kanyakumari, the southern most tip of India,on 25-27 December 1892, Swamiji began his work for the revival of India .  It is the same stone situated at the confluence of the three seas, where “Shripad” of Mata Kanyakumari still exists.  The memorial has been constructed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS) Pracharak, Honourable Eknath Ranadeji, who brought the memorial to life by establishing the ""Vivekananda Kendra"" – a spiritually oriented Service Mission in 1972. In 1963, the birth centenary of Swamiji was celebrated all over the country. On this occasion, the locals of Kanyakumari formed a committee to build a memorial on that historic rock.  Due to obstacles at various levels, that committee approached the then RSS Sarsanghchalak, Shri Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar ji, who entrusted the responsibility to Eknathji .While on the one hand Tamil Nadu Chief Minister  M. Bhaktavatsalam categorically refused to give approval for any construction on the rock, on the other hand Humayun Kabir, the Union Minister for Cultural Affairs, created hurdles by saying ""the monument on the rock will spoil the natural beauty"". By his efficient management, patience and purity, Eknathji kept the issue public, he met various leaders and personalities in Delhi and apprised them of the subjectat various levels by keeping it away from politics .   Eknathji raised Members of Parliament (MPs) of various political parties from their individual political differences  to ""Bharatiyata” and in three days reached the then Home Minister Shri Lal Bahadur Shastriji with the signature of 323 MPs.  When such a large number of MPs expressed their desire to build a memorial, the message was clear that the entire country is in favour of the memorial, Congress or Socialist, Communist or Dravidian all leaders agreed in unison. Permission was now secured, but where would the money come from? Eknathji sought cooperation from each and every province, ranging from the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Sheikh Abdullah to Hokishe Sema of Nagaland .When he met the left Communist leader Jyoti Basu,, then the Deputy Chief Minister of West Bengal , He said- "" it appears to me that you couldn’t have come to meet this Jyoti Basu  because I have  nothing to do with Vivekananda “ . Eknathji said- ""How can I believe that you have nothing to do with Swamiji?""  Didn't he raise his voice for the downtrodden?  You are also the benefactors of the downtrodden. Like you,he was also the defender of the oppressed.  Jyoti Basu said: “Yes, from this point of view, I admire him because he was the representative of oppressed and downtrodden”, but he expressed his inability due to his membership of the Communist Party.” Irrespective of the party in power, almost all the state governments donated Rupees one lakh each. The first donation of Rs 10,000 for the memorial was made by Swami Chinmayananda of ""Chinmaya Mission"" to the Vivekananda Rock Memorial Committee.  Eknathji connected Smt. Kamala Basu (Jyoti Basu’s wife) with the work. Eknathji told her that he will give her the receipt book and then she can collect whatever amount possible from her personal contacts, Smt. Basu replied that she have never made any collections but if Eknathji don’t have any high expectations from her, she will definitely approach her contacts for this work. Eknathji said even if you know ten persons approach them. Inform them about this work, and in reply whatever amount they give you can take, ten or Hundred rupees. This might not turn into a huge amount, but still you may be able to do something for us.  Smt. Basu did her best and she was able to contribute 1100 rupees through her friends and relatives.  By doing so, Eknathji got various ideologies to enter the ""confluence of “Bharatiyata”. Irrespective of the party in power, almost all the state governments donated Rupees one lakh each.  The first donation of Rs 10,000 for the memorial was made by Swami Chinmayananda of ""Chinmaya Mission"" to the Vivekananda Rock Memorial Committee.  To connect the society with the memorial, nearly 30 lakh people gave contributions in the denominations of Rupees 1, 2 and 5 .  About one per cent of the adult population at that time participated in it.  Swami  Vireshwarananda ,President of Ramakrishna Math and Mission consecrated Vivekananda Rock Memorial and it was formally inaugurated on 2nd  September 1970 by Shri V. V. Giri, President of India.  The inauguration ceremony lasted for about 2 months and the Prime Minister of India, Smt. Indira Gandhi also attended.            ""Vivekananda Kendra - a spiritually oriented service organization"" was established on 7 January 1972 to give life to the memorial.  Thousands of volunteers of Vivekananda Kendra conduct activities in the tribal and rural areas - like education and natural resource development, cultural research, publications, youth engagement programme “sanskar” classes and yoga classes for all. This is the Golden Jubilee year of this monument, which is in a true sense a national memorial . A memorial for whose construction all MPs, irrespective of their political affiliations appealed for,for which people donated from all over the country , the only memorial for which almost all state governments donated minimum one lakh rupees each . Celebrating its 50th year, the Vivekananda Kendra initiated the ""Ek Bharat, Vijayi Bharat"" connectivity campaign by meeting the President and Prime Minister of India ,through this connectivity campaign the volunteers  of  Vivekananda Kendra will contact thousands of people from different sections of the society and inspire them by ""giving  the message of Swami Vivekananda as well as motivating them to contribute for the welfare and promotion of the society.""

Dogri reflects the Dogra culture and heritage, and so it should be put at a premium pedestal along with other languages of J&K. Significantly, Dogri language is originally spoken in Jammu division. In 2001, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee included Dogri language in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. However, this language was not the official language of Jammu and Kashmir. Dogri language is mainly spoken in 10 districts of Jammu division. The proposal of Dogri to be the official language of the Central Government will also convey the message of equality and development to the people of Jammu division in the state.

After wishing audience on the occasion of Teacher’s Day, Guruji commenced the session by explaining the topic and stressed that it is education that leads to empowerment. In response to Prafulla Ji’s question highlighting the indispensability of right proportion of different forms of knowledge in education, Guruji emphasized that “One cannot become human without education”. Elaborating on the 3 types of vidya as per Bharateeya tradition– avidya, vidya and paravidya, Guruji explained that education through its avidya form becomes means of our material prosperity, through its vidya form it builds our character to uphold values and through its para-vidya aspect makes us embodiment of happiness, bliss and peace. He also added that in life, material and spiritual should go hand in hand deftly like the 2 wings of a swan. That’s what Sahaj Smriti Yog is about. Prafulla ji talking on the importance of Guru stated that Guru is one who works for good of all and happiness of all. He added that beneath all the diversity that we see, there is a oneness  irrespective of the various names given to it. He asked many deep and inquiring questions to Guruji which are pertinent for our current times like how to weave in Bharateeya way of vidya into our education system, the concept of patents in current development model, how to see empowerment from Bharateeya drishti etc. Seekers asked many profound and meaningful questions to both Guruji and Prafulla ji including how one can lead a dharmic life in the current materialistic world, how one can see life as beautiful despite the miseries etc. Darpan Foundation has been organising meaningful conversations between propounder of Sahaj Smriti Yog Guruji Shri Nandkishore Tiwari and excellent professionals comprising of individuals from all walks of life.

Sri Kesavananda Bharati Swamiji of Edaneeru Matha Kasaragodu whose case in SC helped establish the Basic structure doctrine of the Constitution passes away, 06-Sep-2020,,"Sri Keshavananda Bharati Swamiji of Edaneeru Matha Kasaragodu passed away Sri Keshavananda Bharati was born to Manjathaya Sreedhara Bhatt and Padmavathi. He took to Sanyasa at a young age of 19 and later became the head of Edaneeru Matha in 1960.  The Edneeru Matha has a history of 1200 years and belongs to the parampara of Sri Totakacharya, one of the first four disciples of Sri Adi Shankaracharya. The legal battle led by Kesavananda Bharati was one of the most historical and long cases to protect fundamental rights. The case known as 'The Kesavananda Bharati Case' is one of the most cited judgments in the legal fraternity when it comes to the basic structure of the constitution. Keshavananda Swamiji had filed a writ questioning the 29th Amendment of Constitution in 1971, Kerala Land Reforms Act in 1969 and the Kerala Land Reforms Amendment Act in 1971. Following this, Keshavananda Swami became the first petitioner to question the amendment of fundamental rights. Due to the political relevance of the case, intense pressure was imposed on the court from the very beginning by the then ruling establishment. The Supreme Court full bench consisting of 13 judges tried the case for 66 days creating another history. Kesavananda Bharati case made it to the headlines of newspapers in the country every day during that period. The majority that delivered the landmark verdict in the Kesavananda Bharati case on April 24, 1973, (from left) then Chief Justice of India S M Sikri, and Justices J M Shelat, K S Hegde, A N Grover, P Jaganmohan Reddy, A K Mukherjea and H R Khanna (IE Photo) The government argued in the court that the Constitution can be amended to ensure the upliftment of the common people and social justice. The judiciary and the government were engaged in verbal duel in the court over the nature and basic structure of the constitution. Finally, the judiciary prevailed as the Supreme Court pronounced the verdict with a 6-7 majority that the fundamental rights in the Constitution cannot be amended by the Parliament. The historical verdict was pronounced on April 24, 1973. It was also known that the judges who took a stand against the government were denied promotions by the subsequent Congress governments.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/6/Sri-Kesavananda-Bharati-Swamiji-of-Edaneeru-Matha-Kasaragodu-passes-away.html

State assisted conversions in AP? 70% of Christian pastors who received govt honorarium through Disaster Relief Fund hold SC/OBC caste certificates, 10-Sep-2020,,"In a startling revelation by Legal Rights Protection Forum (LRPF), 70% of the 29,841 Christian pastors who received one-time government honorarium of Rs.5, 000 through Disaster Relief Fund hold SC/OBC caste certificates. LRPF obtained the relevant details through an RTI which revealed that a large percentage of Christians who have been baptised and have undergone Pastor Training courses but holding Hindu Caste Certificates have obtained one-time relief honorarium of Rs. 5,000/- each. The honorarium was given by the Andhra Pradesh government to all ‘Religious Service Renderers’ which includes Archakas, Imams, Mouzzams and Christian Pastors who were facing hardship and distress of various religious institutions, as a measure of relief arising out of break out of COVID-19 Pandemic. The AP government has spent close to Rs. 34 crores on the one-time honorariums on 31,017 Archakas, 7000 Imams  & Mouzzams and 29,841 Pastors which was credited to the respective beneficiaries’ bank accounts. LRPF investigation revealed that while the official estimate of population of the Christians in AP is 1.39%, 43.99% of the honorarium beneficiaries are Christian Pastors. The data clearly shows that a large percentage of Christians who have been baptised and have undergone Pastor Training courses continue to hold Hindu Caste Certificates only to obtain government benefits like the recent one-time relief honorarium during COVID lockdown.  Since holding of dual religious identities for government benefits is punishable under law, LRPF has complained to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes to take action and immediately order Government of Andhra Pradesh to submit to the Commission the complete list of Christian Pastors who have received Rs. 5,000/- as one-time disaster relief as mentioned above, together with religion/community details of all the 29,841 pastors. LRPF in its complaint letter says that their sample data has revealed that 58.14 % of Christian pastors are actually holding Hindu-SC community certificates and 13.37 percentage of the Christian pastors are holding Hindu OBC Community certificates. On a conservative basis, if it is assumed that 70 percent of the pastors listed above carry Hindu community certificates (sample data reveals 80.81%), the total figure of such pastors come to 20,900. The amount received by them at Rs. 5000 per head comes to Rs. 10.45 Crores which is clearly fraudulent misuse of public money, says the LRPF complaint.  LRPF has requested the commission to initiate appropriate action to safeguard the interests of Scheduled Caste communities of Andhra Pradesh and weed out converts who have illegally obtained SC/OBC Communities certificate through fraudulent misrepresentation of facts. “We once again fervently appeal to you to send a fact-finding mission to the state of Andhra Pradesh and initiate steps to save the people of Scheduled Castes/OBC of Andhra Pradesh from becoming culturally extinct. The onslaught of Christian Evangelical lobby with financial support of thousands of crores of rupees through FCRA funds, hundreds of foreign evangelists coming to Andhra Pradesh indulging in brazen conversions, baptisms and a huge army of local native Christian pastors have set up on the ground in AP – all these have crushed the SCs of Andhra Pradesh and pushed them to the brink of extinction. SCs of Andhra Pradesh exist only on paper and in reality, our experience has shown that only 10-15 % of the SCs are real Hindu SCs clinging on to their ancestral religion, culture and civilisation. These people are small in number, politically insignificant and don’t count in vote bank politics. Hence, they require your valuable support”, urges LRPF in its letter. State assisted conversions LRPF complaint letter also shares details of the government appeasement of so-called minorities at the cost of Hindus and the finances of the state. The present government in Andhra Pradesh had proposed regular monthly payment to religious service renderers and applications were called from Christian pastors to apply for the same. Strangely, the state government has not made it mandatory to submit Christian community certificate by prospective beneficiaries while submitting applications. “This has enabled a large number of Christians holding Hindu community certificates to apply and benefit from the one-time payment of Rs. 5,000/-. As and when the government fulfils its election promise of monthly payments to pastors, all these people will enjoy the benefit every month. This is serious abuse and defrauding of public exchequer”. Says LRPF. “This is direct encouragement of the present government to SCs to convert to Christianity yet corner all the constitutional benefits of SCs without any hassles”, says the letter to the SC Commission.  It can be recalled that the AP government recently released funds for construction/repair/renovation of 76 Churches at a cost of Rs. 5.00 lakhs each. The earlier government of Andhra Pradesh has, during the period 2014- 19, funded construction of 817 churches. Most of these are located in SC colonies or where large number of SCs are living. This is direct encouragement of conversions of SCs into Christianity. It is a matter of deep concern to us that successive governments have resorted to supporting conversions into Christianity. LRPF data also reveals that recently an NGO – Samarasta Seva Foundation conducted a survey of SCs at Chilukuru Village, Ibrahimpatnam Mandal, Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh. The following are the telling statistics from the village.  Though the figures are shocking, the situation is more or less same across the districts of Krishna, Guntur, East Godavari and West Godavari in AP. “Today a pathetic situation has arisen wherein officials and common man have concluded that ‘All people of Scheduled Castes are are Christians unless proved otherwise’. Identity of the people of Scheduled Castes as Hindus has been washed away in the deluge of Evangelists’ tsunami.” says LRPF. “We are deeply concerned at this development as the SCs/OBCs of Andhra Pradesh with thousands of years of cultural heritage, civilizational achievements and deep religious practices now face extinction. Their way of life, their daily religious worship, celebration of festivals – all are being wiped out in front of their own eyes, with active financial/administrative support from successive governments”, says LRPF. LRPF investigation also reveals that there is a huge jump in population of SCs while there is sharp decline in number of Christians. This is possible only when large number of Christians have started declaring themselves as Hindu-SCs and obtaining relevant community certificates enabling them to illegally corner all the benefits designed to uplift the livelihood of SCs. Such a large-scale misuse is not possible without active connivance of the administration in the state. LRPF says that not just the present regime in AP, but all previous governments from the past 5 decades are to be blamed for the same as they turned a blind eye or actively assisted such misuse of benefits of Scheduled Castes.  Urging the SC/ST commission to launch an immediate enquiry into the whole issue, the LRPF requests them to send a high-power fact-finding committee to Andhra Pradesh to study the issue of large scale misuse of reservation benefits of SCs/OBCs and help the genuine SCs to utilize their legitimate constitutional benefits.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/10/Andhra-Pradesh-70-percent-Christian-pastors-who-received-govt-honorarium-hold-SC-OBC-caste-certificates.html

The riots which started after Ashura reportedly continues even after several days. According to reports, the Sunni community in the country was provoked by a broadcast of an Ashura procession last month. Ashura commemorates the killing of Hussein, grandson of Muhammed, at the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. Video clips of the riots and protests have gone viral on social media. In a video, Sunni extremists atop buses can be seen waving flags and shouting Anti-Shia slogans and heard shouting “Kafir, Kafir Shia Kafir (Infidels, infidels, Shia infidels)”. The persecution of Shia Muslims in Sunni-majority Pakistan is not a new phenomenon. Shias who constitute 20% of the Muslims in Pakistan and are often targeted during Muharram processions.

China hikes prices of key pharma ingredients to scuttle India’s Atmanirbhar plan: Pharma experts tell govt to promote public sector units to meet Chinese challenge, 23-Sep-2020,,"In a bid to scuttle India’s efforts to achieve self-reliance in the pharma sector, China has increased prices of key starting materials (KSMs) up to 20 per cent, according to a report in Times of India.  However, China has left prices of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) unchanged. India is heavily depended on China for KSMs and APIs, as much as 80 per cent. For certain key antibiotics like penicillin, the dependence is almost 90 per cent. According to the report, any increase in prices of KSMs will discourage indigenous API manufacturing, making units unviable and APIs less competitive against Chinese products globally. In the wake of standoff with China, India has incentivised indigenous manufacturing of APIs. However, experts say the Chinese move will have an adverse impact on the pharma sector. But through consistent policy initiatives, the threat posed by the Chinese could be neutralised. They said that the government should promote Public Sector Units (PSUs) for manufacturing APIs.  According to an expert, PSUs played a major role in the development of Indian pharmaceutical industry. First, PSUs made huge investments and produced APIs and provided this to the formulation industry, which was in the private sector. Further, the PSU also played a role in the technological dissemination and human resource training. However, the public sector units in the pharmaceuticals and vaccines need intensive care or a reboot. According to the annual report of the Department of Pharma (DoP) there are only five pharmaceutical PSUs with the central government.  Out of these five PSUs, two are sick, one is incipient sick and two are in Rs 25-crore profit each. The role of PSU need not be competing with the private sector in all circumstances and could complement each other. The backbone of the pharmaceutical industry is the API production. The public sector can invest and achieve economies of scale in the production of API and intermediaries and supply to the private sector for formulations. Similarly, the new areas like bio therapeutics need huge investment that can be filled by the private sector. Even the Katoch Committee recommended infusion of capital to each PSU to start manufacturing of important APIs. The Javed Chaurdary Committee recommended that “insulate the UIP from price and supply shocks a cardinal principle of public health policy requires the sourcing of the vaccines from public sector manufacturing units to a substantial extent”. Though the public sector reliability is accepted within the policy circles the fear of criticism of taking back to license raj prevents the political leadership to take concrete actions in this regard.   Though India’s PSU management bears the threat of political interference the experiences of South East Asian countries especially Singapore show that there can be different management structure for  PSU. Government can set up plants and lease to the private sector with assured supply commitments. The leasing out  model is already implemented at the medical device park at Visakhapatnam. Government should implement this model in API and vaccines. The Government should move away from the  revival of the sick public sector and should approach it as a restart. Towards this end the government should take over the existing  fixed assets and start new PSU manufacturing with updated technologies and management approach.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/23/China-hikes-prices-of-key-pharma-ingredients-to-scuttle-India-s-Atmanirbhar-plan.html

Both the countries have agreed on a five-point roadmap including quick disengagement of troops and avoiding any action that could escalate tensions for resolving the 4 month long face off in eastern Ladakh. The Indian side strongly raised the deployment of large number of troops and military equipment by China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and conveyed its concern.

"“Return Nepal’s Land, Stop Chinese Expansionism”: Anti-China protests erupt in Kathmandu", 23-Sep-2020,,"A group of Nepalese citizens has protested against China in Kathmandu yesterday. People under the banner of Lumbini Civil Society have registered their strong objection against the Chinese encroachment in Humla and illegal construction on Nepal’s land. The Society has also voiced against the intervention of China in the domestic affairs of Nepal. Raising their voice against the expansionist Communist regime, the protesters were seen holding placards and banners featuring slogans such as “Return Nepal’s land, stop Chinese expansionism and stop oppression on Muslims.” The border dispute between Nepal and China has resurfaced after it was revealed that China constructed nine buildings on Nepali territory in Humla district. According to reports, this issue came into light when the president of the local village council, Vishnu Bahadur Lama, went on a visit to this territory. He revealed that China soldiers had completed the building construction in the Limi village of Lapcha village. He was even prevented from going to the side of the village where the construction had taken place. Lama claimed that he even tried to speak to the Chinese forces in vain and they did not respond and he was even told to go back. After denied entry into the region, he took a few pictures of the newly-constructed building by Chinese PLA in the territory on his mobile phone — which show the buildings were erected nearly 2 kilometres into Nepali territory. The Nepali side claims that there was a border pillar (Pillar No. 11) of Nepal and China at the place where the structures were built.  However, the border pillar is missing. Neither Nepal's Home Ministry nor Foreign Ministry has issued a statement in this regard. Similar protests have been reportedly erupted in various parts of the country as the government has chosen to keep mum over the issue.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/23/Nepalese-citizens-protest-against-China-in-Kathmandu.html

Revisiting Shri Kartik Oroam’s Thoughts and Legacy, 29-Oct-2020,Vivekanand Motiram Nartam ,"Shri Kartik Oraon also lovingly called by his followers as Baba Kartik Saheb was highly qualified tribal leader from the present day Jharkhand state of India. A politician of utmost commitment to the society that he led, he represented Lohardaga Parliamentary constituency for three times in the Lok Sabha. He also rose to become minister for aviation and communication of Government of India by dint of his hard work and passion to serve the society and nation. His was a committed life for the upliftment of tribal populace and he toiled endlessly for the cause of protection and preservation of tribal life and culture from evangelical aggressions. He was born in a village named Karounda Littatoli of Gumla District of Jharkhand state on 29 October 1924 to Jaira Oraon (Father) and Birsi Oraon (Mother) belonging to Kurukh tribe. After completing high schooling from Gumla in 1942, he passed Intermediate examination from Science College, Patna, and completed bachelor of engineering from Bihar College of Engineering, Patna. Thereafter he moved to England and completed his further studies in engineering from Royal College of Science and Technology, Glasgow and Battersea College of Technology, London University. He also studied Bar-at-Law at the Lincoln's Inn, London. It is a matter of pride for Indians that during his stay in England for 9 years, he prepared a design of the world's largest automatic power station for the British government in 1959. Today it is known as 'Hinckley Nuclear Power Plant'. Shri Kartik Oraon returned to India in 1961and he took over the post of Superintendent Construction Designer at HEC. Along with this, he also designed the building of BAU and Central Library. Later he was promoted to the post of Deputy Chief Design Engineer, but seeing the condition of the tribals of Chhotanagupar at that time; he resolved to work for the society and entered politics in 1962. He was not only a skilled engineer, but also an excellent politician. In the leadership of Acharya Vinoba Bhave Ji, in 1968, when the Bhoodan movement was intensifying, the land of the tribals was being sold at a cheaper price. At such a time, Karthik Oraon appealed to Mrs. Indira Gandhi to protect the tribals from depriving them of their land thereby becoming landless. He became successful in persuading Mrs. Gandhi, the then Prime Minister and arrangements were made to get back the lost land of tribals by enacting an act on the issue. It was due to Shri Kartik Uroan’s relentless efforts that Birsa Agricultural University was established at Ranchi. He was instrumental in the creation of ‘Tribal Sub Plan’ on the basis of which presently the Central and State Governments are running various development schemes for the development of tribes. He will always be remembered for his most significant contributions to save tribals of their culture and traditions which were facing grave threats (they still do) in the wake of onslaught of evangelical missions that were hell bent upon converting tribal people into Christianity.  As a part of his fight against unscrupulous attempts to convert tribals, he submitted a memorandum to the government of India signed by 322 members from Lok Sabha and 26 members from Rajya Sabha in 1967. The document unequivocally asks for putting restriction on the reservation benefits to the converted individuals meant for Scheduled Tribes (STs). The suggestions in the said memorandum were countered by 50 members of the Lok Sabha in the Indira Gandhi government who were acting on the behest of Christian missions in India. Despite Kartik Uroam’s relentless efforts the recommendations in the memorandum could not be implemented as the Christian missions put tremendous pressure on Indira Gandhi to not to implement them. The suggestions in the memorandum were absolutely in line with the recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Order (Amendment) Bill, 1967. The committee had recommended the following amendment: “2A. Notwithstanding anything contained in the parliament in Paragraph 2, no person who has given up tribal faith or and has embraced either Christianity or Islam shall be deemed to be a member of any Scheduled Tribes ( Vide Para 2A, page 29, line 38 of the Schedule II of the report). Such an amendment had already been done in the case of Scheduled Castes (SCs) in 1956 which reads as under – “3. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Paragraph 2, no person who professes a religion different from the Hindu or Sikh Religion shall be deemed to be a member of Scheduled Castes” Timely implementation of the recommendations mentioned in the memorandum submitted by Shri Kartik Uroam and the Joint Parliamentary Committee would have proved a step in the right direction. At present huge population of tribals is lured to convert to Christianity, the northeastern states being the worst affected region of India. According to the latest published note on the Religion Data Census of 2011 by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) Mizoram Manipur and Nagaland have now become almost entirely Christian. The Christian Population among STs is in Mizoram is 90.08 percentage and in Manipur and Nagaland is 97.42 and 98.21 percentage respectively. This trend continues among STs in various other parts of India as well. Their conversion to Christianity essentially alienates them of their cultural heritage and indigenous faith that these communities have been following for years. Moreover, the newly converted Christians have started persecuting those who continued to follow their indigenous faith. Also Christian converts are the ones who usurp the reservation benefits the most.  Shri Kartik Uroam anticipated this much earlier and kept fighting for the cause of tribal all his life. In his book “Bees Warsh Ki Kali Raat”, Shri Kartik Uroam has observed that rituals followed by tribals and the Hindus are not placed in contradiction but they are complementary. Citing the examples of Nishadraj, Shabari, Kanappa etc. and various anecdotes mentioned in the ancient Indian texts, he said tribals were Hindus since time immemorial.  In his book he further observed that conversion of Tribals into Christianity has taken place on a massive scale in the independent India than British rule in India. Therefore, as a social activist and a parliamentarian concerned for the cause of tribals, he insisted on the converted tribal people to be put outside the Scheduled Tribes category. On the fateful day of December 8, 1981, Shri Kartik Uraon fell on the floor of the corridor of the Parliament House. He was admitted in the Ram Manohar Lohiya Hospital for the treatment but his condition deteriorated and he left for the heavenly abode. He is no longer in our midst, but his thoughts and actions must serve as the guiding principles for those who work for the tribal cause. His battle for the rights of the tribal people who still adhere to their ancestral faith has till date remained unfinished which needs to be carried forward till the victory is achieved.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/10/29/Revisiting-Shri-Kartik-Oroam-s-Thoughts-and-Legacy.html
Saudi Arabia Excludes Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir from the Map of Pakistan, 28-Oct-2020,,"                                                                                                               Suman Bhattacharyya Ten days after the Beirut Blast of August 4, 2020, Pakistan regarded it as an Independence Day gift when the UAE announced the formalisation of ties with Israel on August 14, 2020. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) was the key force in the deal of ‘normalisation’ of ties between Bahrain and Israel. On October 25, 2020, Yossi Cohen, Israel’s Mossad Chief, in an interview with Channel 12 News, indicated that he expected KSA and Israel to open up their embassies soon after the November 2020 US elections. The KSA-Israel normalisation process had been well on the cards, but the issue which stems from the ‘hubris’ is its fallout, with particular reference to Pakistan. Pakistan criticised Riyadh over the Kashmir issue and incurred the displeasure of the KSA crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (popularly known as MBS). KSA also compelled Islamabad to repay a one billion loan soon after this. Pakistan had saved its face by repaying the debt with the help of China. KSA added further humiliation to Pakistan when it announced that the sum of one billion USD repaid by Pakistan would be invested in Reliance Jio Fiber in India. It just did not stop there. On October  24, 2020, Saudi Arabia released a 20 Riyal banknote to commemorate its presidency of organising a G 20 summit on November 21-22, 2020. The world map displayed at the rear of this commemorative banknote has scraped Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Kashmir from the map of Pakistan. On 05 August 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had removed Article 370 from Jammu & Kashmir, which gave it a special status. China, too, had been irked in the process. China and Pakistan have thrice dragged the Kashmir Issue to the UN Security Council in the past year. While China tried to stake its claim inside Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh, Pakistan tried desperately to form a new bloc with Turkey, Iran, Malaysia, China and Russia, outside the traditional dictates of the US. According to the official KSA stand now, Pakistan has no legitimacy over Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir. This is a blow to Pakistan which had released the country’s new political map on 05 august 2020, leading New Delhi to term it as ‘political absurdity.’ The current priorities of Saudi Arabia are inclined towards India, as the kingdom is slated to invest 15 billion USD in India’s Reliance Industries. According to media sources, it is also likely to invest in a 60 billion USD oil refinery in India. The KSA-India economic ties strengthened with a rejection of any financial aid to Pakistan is a new marker in international relations. With the current world order in place, KSA, Israel and India are expected to enjoy a ‘springtime’ in the Gulf region. The KSA’s attitude towards Pakistan may also be ‘read’ as targeted against China, as China is to carve its CPEC through Gilgit- Baltistan and it was on the advice of China that Pakistan had recently announced Gilgit- Baltistan to be its fifth province, where elections are scheduled to be held on 15 November. When India decided to put on air GB weather report on 08 May 2020, China was alerted and raised the tensions on the Indian border. The bold Indian move was perceived to be the most potential threat to its coveted project of CPEC. The depiction of the map of Pakistan devoid of Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan by KSA is a severe blow to the country and has adequately disgraced Pakistan in the international arena, particularly in the Muslim world. In the emergent world order, USA and India are pitted against Pakistan. Now the KSA joins in and will help the US to finally contain China.

US presidential election 2020: What does this election mean for Indian Americans and the bilateral relationship between Indian and the US?, 26-Oct-2020,-Preity Upala,"The United States Presidential election is at its final stretch. In some ways, this is the most extraordinary election. It is the most crucial election this country has ever seen, and yet it is the most subdued election in history. So how do the two presidential candidates, President Donald Trump and Candidate Joe Biden fare? Foreign policy will be at the heart of this election in many ways. With a dwindling economy, high unemployment and a global pandemic, President Trump will want to make China the central theme of his campaign in the months leading up to the election. And if he did, he would have a lot of support across the country. Recent polls have shown that there is an incredible amount of distrust and disdain towards China. This would fit in nicely with the President's agenda. On the other hand, Biden is not known to have had a tough stance on China, and the public is not convinced that he would take China to the task. He does not have a history of being tough on China with his son, Hunter Biden involved in foreign companies whether it is Ukraine or China. The Democratic Party is not known to have made national security, counter-terrorism or the threat of a rising imperialistic China the main agenda for their campaign and phrases of holding china accountable seem to have fallen on deaf ears. It appears that there is no actual enthusiasm for Biden, but the party is rallying behind him as the only sentiment seems to be anti-Trump and perhaps nothing more. There is little in the way to counter the current administration's policies. Violent protests and riots across significant cities since April have been weaponised and politicized for political gain and are predicted only to get tenser. After what happened in 2016 with national polls predicting a Hillary victory right up to the day of the election, it would not be wise to take the polls too seriously. The next factor to look at is this economy. The general rule is that during a phase of economic growth, the incumbent has a high chance of being re-elected. The US economy today has had it's sharpest contraction since WW2. This pandemic has had irreversible ramifications for the US economy. It's been seen as the worst quarter on record. A second-quarter decline of about 33% and the unemployment figures at 11%, with the unemployment payments quickly evaporating, it may be tenable to predict a recession and possibly a depression in the following years to follow. The financial situation may be more damaging than the actual pandemic itself. What does this election mean for Indian Americans and the bilateral relationship between Indian and the US as a whole? At 4 million, Indian Americans make up a tiny ethnic minority community in the US. Although they happen to be the most educated and wealthiest ethnic group, they have not been politically relevant in the past. However, this is one election where they may be influential than usual, and perhaps their voice could carry more mileage than it ever did. Indian Americans, in some way, are stuck between a rock and a hard place. While they align with values espoused by the Democratic Party with 77% voting for Clinton in 2016, this may change. Certain factions of the DNC took recent stances and attitude seem to have been antagonistic to the Government of India's recent decisions such as the Abrogation of Article 370, passing of the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and the NRC (National Registry of Citizens). A lot of Indian Americans see this as interference into the internal matters of a sovereign country. Some of the statements made by Democratic candidates Biden and Harris show a biased and distorted view of the reality on the ground. An attack on the Indian Government has been seen as an attack on the community itself. These recent actions have been bought in democratically with an overwhelming majority across both Upper and Lower houses of the Indian parliament as well as supported by Indians far and wide. As well as antagonising a major ally, Biden has been seen to be pandering to large Islamic groups to garner votes, while not condemning terrorist attacks and persecution of religious minorities in regions like Pakistan and Balochistan. What to expect in the next month? America is searching for its Soul. Today, it is a divided country. The dwindling economy, race riots and the pandemic does not seem to be going anywhere. The divisive state of affairs on the ground may lead to more violent protests and riots leading up to the election and well into the end of the year. There are 1.8 million Indian Americans eligible to vote this November. Majority of these are in the coastal states of New York and California which are heavily Democrat. It will be the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Texas and Florida that will be deciding the election. President Trump won these with a tiny margin of 85,000 in 2016. He will have to sustain the margin again in November if he wishes to be re-elected. Perhaps this is where the Indian-American voters could make the difference. There are more than enough Indians to make that margin that is needed. One could say, there may be 300,000 'Patels' some of these areas alone! Several groups of Indian Americans are mobilizing digitally for the current President to ensure that he makes it over the line. The Indian American diaspora will make their choice in November when it is time to vote. No doubt it will think about what is best for the futures of the two countries. It is imperative that the world's largest democracy in the world and the world's oldest democracy in the world ought to work closely together. The US- India relationship is the most important strategic partnership in the next half-century. If COVID has taught us anything, it is to make us think about the kind of world that we want to live in and the kind of powers we want running it!",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/10/26/Indian-Americans-hold-the-Trump-card-at-the-US-Presidential-elections.html
Islamists target Hindus in Bangladesh in the pretext of anti-France protests, 02-Nov-2020,,"Suman Bhattacharyya Two Al- Qaeda terrorists, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had, on January 7, 2015, forced their way into the premises of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people and injuring 11 others. In early September, Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, defended the right to freedom of speech and expression, in response to Charlie Hebdo, which announced it was set to republish cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. Macron’s stand was criticized by Muslim groups all over the world. The criticism and condemnation by the Muslim groups often flared into violent protests. In one such recent incident, triggered by the position of the French President and vehement protests by Islamists, several Hindu houses were attacked and burnt down in Comilla district of Bangladesh. The incident occurred on the night of Lakshmi Puja on 31 October 2020, in Kurbanpur village under Muradpur in Comilla. The rioters did not even spare the house of the local Union Board Chairman, Ban Kumar Shib. Interestingly, the Bangladesh Police have arrested a Hindu school teacher and his friend on charges of blasphemy. The local magistrate cancelled his bail petition and sent him to jail. The Police justified themselves on the ground that they were arrested on charges of blasphemy and creating unrest. However, the Bangladesh Police have not arrested any of the rioters involved in arson, loot and violence. Several Hindu organizations in Bangladesh have protested against this ghastly incident in Muradpur and demanded justice. Ruma Modak, renowned theatre activist and college teacher in Bangladesh, has written a long social media post depicting the violence and atrocities committed on Hindus in the country. According to local sources, the arrested Hindu teacher, Principal of a local kindergarten, has some relatives in France. One of his relatives apparently posted a congratulatory note on social media celebrating Macron’s stand on the defence of freedom of speech and expression and combating radical Islam. The school teacher from Kurbanpur had shared this post. This led to the communal riot in the villages of Kurbanpur and adjacent Andikot, where a few hundred Muslims attacked Hindu houses causing rampant loot, arson and desecration of the household idols on the fateful evening of Lakshmi Puja. Ban Kumar Shib, who is a local Professor and influential political leader in the area, had tried to pacify the Muslim rioters and tried for a negotiation. But all his efforts went in vain as the rioters were adamant. Shib’s house was also eventually attacked and set on fire that night.  Bangladesh Police have claimed that they deployed 4 platoons of security forces in these two villages to control the situation.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/11/2/CommunalViolenceinBangladesh-.html

Assam TV channel forces reporter to resign as she became pregnant and requested transfer to news desk, 25-May-2020,,"Guwahati based journalist Ranjita Rabha was forced to resign from her position in Prag News after she became pregnant and the channel refused to shift her to news desk.  - NJ Thakuria Guwahati: A city based satellite news channel comes under fire from various media rights bodies and social organizations as its management forced a reporter to resign as she attained pregnancy and requested the editor for shifting her works to the news desk. The channel authority bluntly declared that it has no provision for maternity leave to women workers. Taking serious note of the incident, a group of senior journalists based in Guwahati have sought the intervention Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal to ensure justice for the scribe belongs to the indigenous Rabha community. They argued that the incident would send a wrong signal against the recruitment of women in offices and it would finally jeopardize the campaign for women's empowerment in the country. Earlier, expressing deep shock and concern ‘at the manner in which Guwahati based journalist Ranjita Rabha was forced to resign from her position in Prag News’, the Network of Women in Media, India (NWMI) called upon the National Commission for Women and the State Commission for Women to take suo moto cognizance of the issue. “Ms Rabha has been a journalist for 13 years and it is a gross violation of her rights that she was forced to resign by the highest authority of Prag News …,” said a statement issued by NWMI adding that the incident is particularly distressing at a time when media houses across India were effecting job losses, wage cuts and forced leave without pay during an unprecedented lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. She as well as her elder brother, a popular theatre personality of Assam, took to social media to detail how she had even offered to go on 'leave without pay' so that she could rejoin work at the earliest after childbirth. But the management instead asked her to resign forthwith. Meanwhile, she informed that she has been deprived of benefits under  Employees' State Insurance Corporation  because of the management’s fault. ""My sister is forced to resign from Prag News (Assam) because of her pregnancy!!! Is there any law?"" queried Pabitra Rabha in an anguished facebook post. It has been reliably learnt that some other employees of the channel were also shown the door recently as a cost cutting measure due to the Covid-19 crisis. It is galling that some media houses are doing precisely this, that too when journalists are risking their health and working round the clock to gather and disseminate relevant information. “Whatever the reason, a lady scribe must not be asked to leave her post because of a natural process of conceiving after marriage,” said a statement issued by senior scribes Biman Chandra Hazarika, Rupam Baruah, Manas Kumar Mahanta, Girindra Kumar Karjee, Mukul Kalita, Sabita Lahkar, Nayan J Bhuyan, Biswajit Nath, Rajib Choudhury, Digambar Patowary, Anjanil Kashyap, Anirban Choudhury, Dipankar Devsarma, Ranjan K Barua, etc. They also observed that at a time when journalists are keeping company with Covid-19 warriors at the forefront so as to keep people informed of the unprecedented crisis, some media houses are displaying rank heartlessness and irresponsibility. Finally they appealed to all media persons, particularly women workers, to rise to the occasion so that the discriminated scribe gets justice and also prevent any kind of attitude and policies that create hostile environment at the workplace. Many other organizations namely Indian Journalist Union, North East Network, Asom Mahila Sangha, Sadou Asom Pragatisheel Naari Santha, Assam unit of Students’ Federation of India, State unit of All India Democratic Women’s Association, etc also come out with media statements arguing that her case shows the violation of rights and entitlements of working women as envisaged in the Constitution (of India) and the Maternity Benefit Act of 1961.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/25/Assam-TV-channel-forces-reporter-to-resign-as-she-became-pregnant-.html

PM helps TN girl secure free seat in Kendriya Vidyalaya school; The girl Rakshita changes name to 'Modi Rakshita' as a mark of gratitude, 31-Aug-2020,,"(Image credit: TheCommuneMag.com)  PM Modi known to surprise citizens with going out of the way to help them, has done it again. In a pleasant news from Tamil Nadu, the Rakshita was a first grade student studying at the Pavithramanikkam Panchayat Union Middle School. Her father Gunasekaran hails from Pavithramanikkam village near Thiruvarur and works at the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Bank. He wanted to admit his daughter in a Kendriya Vidyalaya school in 2015 under the Right to Education Act. However, they were unable to get the seat under RTE. This was when they approached the PMO for help,  The Prime Minister’s Office then responded and informed the Ministry of Education to accommodate Rakshita under the Prime Minister’s quota. But this was not enough for Rakshita to secure a seat as the Kendriya Vidyalaya rules mandated that the student must know Hindi to get admission. Rakshita toiled hard and learned Hindi in a few days after which she was admitted into class 2 in 2016. Surviving on meagre income, Rakshita's father could not afford the school fees. They again wrote to the PM seeking assistance in paying the fees. The PMO intervened again and instructed the Regional Director of Kendriya Vidyalaya Schools in Chennai to exempt fees for Rakshita. As a mark of gratitude to the PM, Rakshita who is currently studying in class 6 changed her name to 'Modi Rakshita'. The incident has again highlighted the concern PM Modi has for the poor especially the girl child.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/31/PM-helps-TN-girl-secure-free-seat-in-Kendriya-Vidyalaya-school.html

The Pulitzer Line and Fire of Separatism, 21-May-2020,,"The Congress party which is increasingly veering to the fringe must also seriously introspect on its future.

Ashta-Laxmi rise to the Occassion, 10-Jun-2020,,"All the North-Eastern states seem to be well prepared to take on this challenge and by the standards of their efforts till date, it will not be a surprise if the region remains the most protected in India from the deadly virus. The combination of good governance and community responsibility is a tough collaboration for even COVID-19 to breach An official checking the temperature of a passenger  In the collective imagination of India the North-East region of India has often in the past had the disadvantage of being overlooked for a multitude of reasons. But in the past six years, with the present government in India making the North East a priority, we have seen the states in the region optimise their potential through not only good governance but also through great individual responsibility. There was a time in late April when 5 out of 8 North-Eastern states were COVID-free. However, with the opening of borders and migrants returning from harder-hit states like Maharashtra and Delhi, the numbers of COVID positive patients in these states may have changed but only marginally. As of June 1, the number of COVID positive patients stood at Mizoram 1, Sikkim 1, Arunachal Pradesh  4, Tripura  268, Manipur  62, Nagaland  37, Meghalaya 27 and Assam the most populous state in the North East and also the gateway to the region at 1,185 infected persons. The response of these states has been nothing short of commendable and while there has been some focus on their success story, it is the Kerala Model that has most often been in the limelight. Though what is important to consider here is that Kerala has been known for its excellence in healthcare as well as its pre-existing infrastructure. The North-Eastern states, on the other hand, are not known for either their healthcare, their infrastructure or their connectivity. Besides, the threat of the spread of COVID-19 in the North-East is also more serious because of the comparatively less availability of high-end treatment facilities and geographical bottlenecks. Despite all their apparent limitations, it is not just a story of success but a story of good governance, community partnership as well as resilience. The region undoubtedly has followed the guidelines of Government of India in letter and spirit. To begin with, what was common to all the states in the region was their timely and strict enforcement of lockdown in adherence to the Government of India norms. Many states had imposed a lockdown even before the initial announcement of a national lockdown by the Hon’ble Prime Minister. The states also revisited continuously and revised their lockdown strategies to keep up with the changing circumstances around the outbreak.  Interestingly, the lockdown was enforced not just by law enforcement agencies but also was managed with community support. This was the novel concept of community quarantine and surveillance seen throughout the North-Eastern states, where a high-risk contact is isolated in the village, in his home and is strictly tracked and supported by the community at large. Due to a predominant tribal population in this region and closely resembling general population, the customary laws in the villages and smaller urban areas ensure registration of the in-migrants with the village headman. This practice ensured limiting the spread of infection as well as successful enforcement of social distancing and quarantine requirements, for instance, in Assam, when a mammoth programme called ‘Assam Community Surveillance’ was undertaken. The surveillance task involved all the villages of the state (around 28,000) to look for SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infections) and ILI (Influenza-like Illness) and fever cases with an aim to test all such cases. Further, the government as per the findings of the testing (be it COVID, JE, Dengue, malaria) decided as a part of its aggressive action plan to not only isolate such patients but also follow up such cases with contact tracing and appropriate treatment. This extensive programme was started in the first week of May and within the first 12 days, health officials had already completed their ambitious survey of 18,000 villages. Further, a staggering 5,84,145 persons were surveyed, 57,436 Gram Sabha meetings were conducted, 12,901 persons who came in contact with COVID-19 positive cases were identified and tested for COVID-19 and 35 people were found positive. Without the involvement of the community at every level their efforts would have failed.  In Manipur too, the State Health Department in collaboration with various community organisations prohibited spitting in public places along with the use and chewing of smokeless tobacco products, pan masala and areca nut in public places and made it a punishable offence. Communities also created shelter huts outside their villages to function as quarantine facilities for people coming from outside the state. Similar initiatives and heartwarming stories of villagers regulating people coming in were many across the region. Mizoram also activated a Local Level Task Force or a Village Level Task Force to monitor the situation as well as to help local villagers with the distribution of food, medical aid and information. Communities across these states in a seamless effort came together with their respective governments to communicate the importance of proper sanitisation, medical tests, quarantine and contact tracing. Many villages made it mandatory to wash hands and feet and follow adequate safety norms before entering the boundaries of the village.  What is also very surprising is that most of the migrants in these states did not request to leave, unlike larger and wealthier states like Maharashtra. For example, in the case of Sikkim, not only were the residents being looked after by ample distribution of food and relief material but not one migrant left the state. There are an estimated 25,000 migrant labour in Sikkim. But due to equal distribution of basic necessities, migrant workers felt safe and their needs were looked after preventing them from moving. This too was in accordance with the request made by the Prime Minister to all the states across the country to take responsibility and to look after their migrant workers. Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma inspecting facilities at a COVID-19 hospital Additionally, the North-Eastern states also very quickly identified the gaps in the facilities that would need to be filled. For instance, due to relatively weak healthcare facilities in the region, only Assam had a few BSL2 laboratories to test for COVID-19. This hampered their ability to increase testing. It also meant that all the other states had to depend on sending their samples to Assam. To increase testing and to save time, many states quickly developed their laboratories and repurposed TB testing facilities (CBNAAT and TrueNAAT) for COVID-19 testing. By April 6 Mizoram, by April 30 Arunachal Pradesh and by the May 14 Nagaland had inaugurated their own labs. Once the other states had their labs, Assam began testing at full capacity. Only last week Health Minister Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that the state had surpassed Kerala for testing for COVID-19. Assam has carried out 55,862 tests so far, surpassing Kerala’s testing count of 52,771. Kerala may be a state with an edge over other states as it is known for its excellent healthcare, but Assam has been a proverbial dark horse in this race to overcome this pandemic.  Many states also began screening as soon as they realised the gravity of the situation across the world. For instance, Manipur started screening people arriving at the Imphal airport from 18-01-2020, well before any other state. It also was the first state to seal its international borders on 09-03-2020. Assam too sealed its international borders with Bhutan and Bangladesh immediately following the instructions of Government of India. While Sikkim closed its doors to domestic tourists on March 17, 2020, this was a callous decision as the state is tourist revenue dependent. However, their doors were closed to even their residents wanting to enter the state. Equal restrictions were accorded to the families of even Judicial personal, bureaucrats, public representatives and entrepreneurs. This was not an exception in the North-Eastern states but this was the norm. All the states managed the lockdown with absolute seriousness even though many depended on tourist revenue.  Though the situation is set to change with many North-East origin migrant workers and students returning to their home states, Nagaland was the last state to record COVID positive cases with all cases having come from outside the state. Arunachal too recorded its single-day spike this week with all cases from migrants that had returned to the state recently. Tripura CM Biplab Deb recently announced that he would be recruiting more doctors and nurses to the state health department to combat the possible increase in cases. Interestingly, the lockdown was enforced not just by law enforcement agencies but also was managed with community support. This was the novel concept of community quarantine and surveillance seen throughout the North-Eastern states, where a high-risk contact is isolated in the village, in his home and is strictly tracked and supported by the community at large Assam too is preparing on a war footing with the knowledge that there are still over 2000 people that are expected back in the coming week. Assam being the gateway to other states in the North-East finds itself in a precarious position. But the state has planned by creating a very comprehensive quarantine infrastructure. With over 30,000 quarantine and mass isolation beds, and nearly 600 ICU beds, the state has booked 1000 rooms in hotels around Guwahati and further identified schools, colleges and Bhawans for quarantine purposes. The final aim is to identify and create facilities to accommodate over 5000 people. Sadly, if only other states had looked after their migrants the way the North-Eastern states have, the region may still have been COVID-19 free. However, all the states in the region seem to be well prepared to take on this challenge and by the standards of their efforts till date, it will not be a surprise if the region remains the most protected in India from the deadly virus. The combination of good governance and community responsibility is a tough collaboration for even COVID-19 to breach.

Disinformation in  Times of A Pandemic, 08-Apr-2020,,"Any kind of panic at this time of epidemic due to unverified and false messages among masses will have devastating effects and compound the miseries of people already suffering The world has been battling a deluge of misinformation and influence operations for a long time now. The advent of internet, social media platforms and real time messengers has given a free run to criminals, miscreants, nation states and other motivated actors. In fact, society today is experiencing something called an ‘information disorder’ where it has become extremely difficult to disambiguate truth from falsehood. Covid19 spread to almost 190 countries, and with more and more people forced to stay home during quarantine, internet usage is bound to be higher than usual as people have resorted to online platforms for working remotely, seeking knowledge, reaching out to loved ones and also at the time of crises people are eager to share personal details and any misinformation at this crucial time can have devastating effect. Tensions have always been a breeding ground of information operations. The Covid19 pandemic has provided such malicious actors with a readymade context to cause disruption and seek profit or take advantage of vulnerable individuals and populace. As the world wrestles with a pandemic caused by a new coronavirus, COVID-19, the authorities around the world are forced to face an avalanche of misinformation / false news about the virus on digital platforms. When it comes to reliability and acceptance of any information, people’s trust have shifted from traditional to internet /social media platforms. Rumors are a lethal weapon that affects the morale of the people. The Law enforcement agencies have power under law to take legal action against anyone who spreads rumors about the virus and causes a state of panic among the general population. Even though, at present, India does not have a specific law to deal with menace of fake news but we still have existing legal provisions under Indian Penal Code, 1860 etc which can be invoked in case of misinformation. Some existing legal provisions are as under: The punishment for making, publishing or circulating any statement, rumour or report which may cause fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public. Punishment: In addition to this punishment if a person commits the offence of criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication, or having taken precaution to conceal the name or abode of the person from whom the threat comes. Punishment: Whoever makes or circulates a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic. Punishment: Imprisonment which may extend to one year or with fine. Before creating, posting, sharing and forwarding any message, one needs to be aware about the implications of the same if not true and create panic in any way. One needs to refrain from forwarding any corona related messages without verifying specially in this age of “infodemic” which the World Health Organisation defines as – “an overabundance of information—some accurate and some not—that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. The Law enforcement agencies are monitoring such posts on social media platforms and can land you in a legal battle or jail. Maharashtra: Ascertaining the source and origin of the message. If one is not sure of the authenticity and correctness of the message or its content, one may make attempts to be sure of the veracity of the matter before forwarding it to others. These simple measures can go a long way in the fight against disinformation and Fake News being spread about the CoronaVirus pandemic. In order to combat the spread of the epidemic disease, India and other nations are taking every set of precautionary measures from advisory of social distancing, quarantine, to lockdowns and curfews. Considering the gravity of the situation governments are issuing circulars/ notifications almost every day, any such government notifications/ advisories if fake or fraudulent posing to be from the government can create havoc. The existing legal provisions do cater to penalizing creation of false content and the malicious distribution thereof, but in the absence of any designated legislation, which enables for timely/instant removal of such content once it has been published. The Ministry of Electronic & Information Technology on March 20 , 2020 issued an advisory to curb false news / misinformation on coronavirus to all the social media platforms (intermediaries u/s 2(1)(w) of Information Technology Act, 2000). This directive advised them to conduct due diligence and take immediate action so as to disable or remove such content hosted on their platforms. The directive further entails them to initiate awareness campaigns for users to not to upload or circulate any such false news or misinformation. The recent initiative of WhatsApp’s launching of a 'Coronavirus Information Hub' in partnership with International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is one such appreciable move. Any kind of panic at this time of epidemic due to unverified and false messages among masses will have devastating effects and compound the miseries of people already suffering. In the coming days when a large portion of the human race remains under lockdowns, the intensity and frequency of online communications is bound to surge. The state and its different enforcement apparatus have to remain ever vigilant in the online and virtual worlds to protect individuals and society from the lurking dangers of an Infodemic. This entails timely detection of content before it goes viral and causes widespread damage, taking it down with the help of social media platforms and intermediaries and tracing the sources of such mischief. Media outlets and the press also have an enhanced responsibility to make people aware and increase literacy about the menace of fake news and misinformation.

Deciphering China’s Belligerence: The fear of losing the Pakistan Card?, 22-Jun-2020,,"Modi government correctly comprehended that India’s China policy could not be seen in isolation to Pakistan, Beijing’s all-weather friend. To tackle the menacing dragon, it was necessary to defang Pakistan which was achieved by scrapping Article 370 and integrating Kashmir fully with India. A weakened Pakistan is not in China’s interests and has rattled the dragon to no end Chinese incursions into the Ladakh region and attempts to change the territorial status quo by force have raised questions on China’s sudden belligerence towards India. While factors such as Beijing’s territorial irredentism coupled with the appropriation of Sun Zi’s strategy ‘to loot the house on fire’, that is to attack India when it is preoccupied with fighting against the Wuhan virus, cannot be discounted. It does not, however, explain why the Chinese leadership is upping the ante when its hands are full. Internally, the pandemic has badly hit its economy with problems of unemployment skyrocketing while anti-China protests in Hong Kong are gathering steam. Also, there is the fear of a second wave of the virus striking China. Externally too, China is almost encircled with rising anti-China voices in the West asking the country to take responsibility for the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. Clearly then, the reasons for belligerence are far deeper than meets the eye. It would be ironical to suggest that the Chinese belligerence is rooted in the Wuhan informal bilateral summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in April 2018. But that’s what explains the reason for dragon blowing fire.  ",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/22/Deciphering-China-s-Belligerence-The-fear-of-losing-the-Pakistan-Card-.html
A Paradigm Shift, 22-Jun-2020,,"While the world is still reeling under the devastating impact of the novel Corona virus pandemic, it has taught us a few unforgettable lessons. Do not depend on anyone, anymore. Stand on your own This quote exemplifies the visionary, problem-solving leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who chose to bring in the most significant indirect tax reform in post-Independent India by implementing the Goods and Services Tax (GST), in his first term in office. From an average tax rate of between 28-31%, in 2013, on most goods and services meant for daily and frequent consumption, post-GST that was introduced in July 2017, average tax rates have come down sharply to less than 18%, with over 90% items of mass usage taxed at either zero or 5%. Barely 28 odd luxury items and “sin goods”, like say aerated/caffeinated drinks and tobacco products, for instance, are taxed at the peak rate of 28% today. GST rollout has also cut down the number of forms to be filed by businesses to just 12 from almost 495, in the pre-GST era. Again, uniform 5% tax is levied for all restaurants, both air-conditioned and non-AC, since 2018, from an earlier 12% GST levy on the food bill in non AC restaurants and 18%, in air-conditioned ones. Effectively speaking, contrary to what critics allege, while the erstwhile Congress-led UPA regime sat on the Kelkar Committee recommendations for ten long years, it was finally the Modi Government which not only made GST a reality but ensured its seamless execution too, notwithstanding a few initial glitches. Consumers got an annual benefit of Rs 1 lakh crore due to GST in 2018-19. Also, with a compliance rate of over 70%, with over 13 million GST filers, suffice to say that GST has succeeded in its endeavour towards replicating the “One Nation, One Tax” model. Apart from GST, a destination-based tax which clearly has been the single biggest indirect tax reform in the last seven decades, the Modi government also brought in sweeping changes in Direct taxes.  Speaking of Direct taxes, “Budget 2020” ushered in a new income tax slab regime with reduced rates for those foregoing 70 tax exemptions and deductions under a “new simplified tax regime”. This new tax system that came into effect from April 1, 2020, is optional and will co-exist with the old tax regime, but is path-breaking, as it gives the taxpayer the freedom to choose and plan, his tax outgo and cash flows. Individuals with a net taxable income of up to Rs 5 lakh per annum will be able to avail tax rebate of Rs 12,500 under section 87-A of the Income Tax Act in both, the existing and new, tax regimes. Effectively, this would mean that individual taxpayers with a net taxable income of up to Rs 5 lakh, will continue to pay zero tax in both tax regimes and, this is certainly a huge bonanza for many. The Modi Government brought in sweeping changes in Direct taxes. “Budget 2020” ushered in a new income tax slab regime with reduced rates for those foregoing 70 tax exemptions and deductions under a “new simplified tax regime” Of late, the recent 4.2% gross domestic product (GDP) print for the financial year 2019-20 for India, has reignited the Modinomics versus Manmohanomics debate. In particular, the GDP print of 3.1% for the March 2020 quarter, has provided fodder to idle minds who know nothing about economics, to start waxing eloquent on how things were much better, under an incompetent Congress. Well, the pleasant truth is things are, indeed, undeniably much better today versus what they were six years back. While the ignominy of a miserable 0.2% GDP growth for the March 2009 quarter belongs to the Congress, the highest GDP growth of 8.2% in fiscal 2016-17, belongs to the Modi Government. Before proceeding further, it should also be noted that while India’s GDP expanded in the March 2020 quarter, albeit by just 3.1%, most large global economies contracted during this quarter. For instance, the USA posted negative growth of 4.8%; China recorded negative growth of 6.8%, Japan grew by minus 5.2% and Singapore and Germany by minus 2.2% each, during the March 2020 quarter. Eurozone contracted at its slowest pace since 1995, by 3.1% for the March quarter, year on year (YoY) and 3.6%, quarter on quarter (QoQ). Indeed, this sharp slowdown globally in the March 2020 quarter had little to do with the Corona virus pandemic or the lockdown. The impact of the epidemic will be felt only in the coming few quarters. Equally, what Modi’s critics and self-styled economists forget is the fact that since 2019, the world economy has been in a rather rough patch due to trade and tariff wars between the USA and China and the great “global auto slowdown”, due to the mandatory transition to BS-VI emission norms. To single out India, which has weathered the storm far better than global counterparts, is therefore unacceptable. What Modi’s critics and self-styled economists forget is the fact that since 2019, the world economy has been in a rather rough patch due to trade and tariff wars between the USA and China Be it launching Rupay cards in Abu Dhabi and Bhutan, spearheading the International Solar Alliance (ISA), or powering the India story at BRICS and the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Modinomics has perfected the subtle art of marrying international diplomacy, soft power and the attendant economic linkages. Modi’s first term in office laid the solid groundwork --the first year of his second term has thereafter decisively built on that strong foundation. Also, be it the world’s biggest healthcare scheme, “Ayushman Bharat”, that has till date benefitted over 1 crore people, or the Rs 6,000 per annum income support scheme, under the “PM Kisan Yojana”, that benefits over 14.5 crore small and marginal farmers, or the “PM Ujjwala Yojana” that gave free gas connections last year, to over 8 crore households, the Modi Government has given last mile connectivity a whole new meaning. Equally, the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme, which has till date, transferred a cumulative sum of Rs 8.91 lakh crore, akin to almost 4.5% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP), showcases how Modinomics is both inclusive and democratic. The world’s largest food security scheme to benefit 80 crore people across the country, with each one getting 7 kg ration per month, during the COVID-related lockdown, is a testimony to Prime Minister Modi’s tremendous execution skills in putting to work, policies, to prevent them from becoming mere paper tigers. In the first year of his second term, Modi’s landmark steps have been many-the decision to implement Rs 102 lakh crore worth of infrastructure projects via the National Infrastructure Ppipeline (NIP), lowering employees’ state insurance act (ESIC) contribution from 6.5% to 4%, which benefits 3.6 crore employees and 12.85 lakh employers, a monthly pension of Rs 3,000 to small traders and shopkeepers in the unorganised sector after they attain 60 years of age under the “PM Shram Yogi Maandhan Yojana”, the bill to repeal 58 archaic laws including outdated labour laws and passing the “Code on Wages Bill” 2019, which will benefit over 500 million workers across the country, raising foreign portfolio investor (FPI) limits in corporate bonds from 9% of the outstanding stock to 15% and, opening up of specific government bond limits for non-resident investors, to carve out a roadmap for India’s inclusion in the emerging market (EM) bond index, have been notable.  Modi’s misguided critics who have been quick to dismiss demonetisation would do well to know that the number of people paying an individual income tax of greater than Rs 1.5 lakh has increased from 13.8 lakh in AY13 to 34.9 lakh in AY19, reflecting how demonetisation dramatically improved tax compliance. As per National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) data, February 2020 saw 132.32 crore UPI transactions totalling Rs 2.2 lakh crore, illustrating how demonetisation has also dramatically enhanced India’s digital footprint. Clearly, in the last one year, Modi has shrugged away any form of incrementalism. Sweeping, big bang reforms have been the norm. Reduction in corporate tax rate from 30% to 22% and for new companies to 15%, 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in coal mining and contract manufacturing, allowing private sector in commercial coal mining on a revenue-sharing basis with no end-use restrictions, 100% FDI via the automatic route in defence manufacturing, single-brand retail and real estate broking services, corporatisation of Ordnance Factory board and, of course, strengthening the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) framework, by ring-fencing new owners of bankrupt companies from criminal liabilities of erstwhile promoters, are measures that underpin, the essence of Modinomics. Decriminalising Sections 7, 9 and 10 of the IBC, to ensure defaults arising from the COVID pandemic are not penalised, are reflective of a government that means business but cares. The Bank Nationalisation Act of 1969, a forgettable vestige of outdated Nehruvian socialism, has been a milestone for PSBs. By merging SBI, with its five associates and the “Bharatiya Mahila Bank” in 2017, Modi created a banking behemoth with an asset size of over Rs 41 lakh crore and over 370 million customers. The decision to thereafter consolidate 10 public sector banks (PSBs) into 4, starting April 2020 and more recently, allowing the private sector to enter into non-strategic areas, with not more than four PSUs in any given strategic sector and of course, the decision to privatise power distribution companies in union territories (UTs), are a reflection of how Modinomics is following the path of “Minimum government, Maximum governance”. More recently, “One nation one ration card”, free food grain supply to migrants, creation of affordable rental housing complexes (ARHCs) in urban areas for migrants, Rs 90,000 crore support for cash starved power distribution companies, Rs 30,000 crore special liquidity scheme for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), housing finance companies (HFCs) and micro finance institutions (MFIs),  Rs 3 lakh crore of collateral free loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and liquidity support of Rs 6,750 crore by bringing provident fund rate down from 12% to 10%,efforts to make India a global maintenance, reach and overhaul (MRO) hub for aviation, throwing open 6 new airports via the public-private partnership (PPP) route to the private sector, changing the definition of MSMEs by including both investment and turnover related criteria, atomic energy reforms, allowing private sector in space exploration and to use indian space research organisation (ISRO’s) facilities, reducing the benchmark Repo rate to 4%,the lowest in 20 years, Rs 2 lakh crore concessional credit for farmers and fishermen via Kisan Credit cards, throwing open 6 new airports for privatisation via the public-private partnership (PPP) route and decriminalising certain offences under the Companies Act, have been part of the Modi government’s Rs 20.97 lakh crore, mega stimulus package, akin to a solid 10.48% of GDP. The Modi Government has launched “Swayam Prabha”, free-to-air education channels, which consists of a group of 32 DTH channels that provide educational content, to those who do not have access to the internet. The other component in the “PM eVIDYA” package is the “DIKSHA” portal (One Nation, One Digital Platform), which will provide quality educational content to researchers and students. Coming back to COVID, unarguably with a high recovery rate of 52.47% and a case fatality rate (CFR) of around 2.7%, India’s track record under Modi has been exceptional. As a way of comparison, the CFR in Germany is 5%, 19% in France, 6% in the US and over 14% in both Italy and the UK. CFR is the proportion of people who die from disease among all individuals diagnosed with the disease. If we look at death per million population, India has recorded roughly four deaths per million, whereas the number for UK is 585, the US is 330, Germany is 104 and Brazil, is 153. Even allowing for our younger demography, our health system has been able to cope up with the pandemic reasonably well and far better than global peers. From being a net importer in March 2020, India has produced well over 1 crore PPE kits in the last 2.5 months, to become one of the largest producers of PPE kits in the world. Clearly, turning crisis into an opportunity is a rare ability and, Modi has that ability in abundance. Modi’s critics have often accused him of being majoritarian--an allegation which is absolutely baseless. For example, over Rs 5,029 crore has been separately allocated for minorities, with over 80 lakh students from minority groups being provided pre-metric, post metric and other “merit cum means” oriented scholarships. One lakh youth from minority communities are being given specialised training in various skill sets. Again, no one can accuse Modi Government of being partisan, by neglecting any particular geography. The North-East, which suffered heavily under previous Congress-led or Leftist regimes, is thriving today. A 1,656 km long gas pipeline is being laid to put this region onto India’s hydrocarbon map. Also, the Agartala-Akhaura rail line, will for the first time, connect India and Bangladesh, via a rail route, besides, of course, drastically reducing the rail commute time between Kolkata and Agartala from over 38 hours to less than 15 hours. Speaking of railways, 5,181 km of railway track has been renewed, over 1,367 bridges renovated and more than 1,274 manned crossings eliminated, in the recent past. Modinomics, among other things, has been very gender-sensitive too, with over Rs 4.78 lakh crore worth of loans given to women borrowers alone, under the MUDRA scheme. While addressing the Indian Chambers of Commerce (ICC) at its 95th annual plenary session on June 11, 2020, the Prime Minister focussed on the importance of families, which are the very core of “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” and underlined the relevance of a people-centric, people-driven and a planet-friendly approach. Marrying economics with environment friendliness is never easy due to the natural conflict involved. However, under Modi, India has managed this conflict seamlessly. For instance, as of March 31, 2020, the country’s total installed power capacity stood at about 372 GW. Of this, the installed power capacity from renewable sources (including large hydro) accounted for about 134.7 GW, or 36.21% of the overall power capacity. This is a huge development, in reducing carbon footprint without sacrificing growth. Don’t forget that when Modi initially took charge in May 2014, renewable sources barely accounted for 5% of the installed capacity, under an utterly incompetent and lethargic Congress. Again, within renewables, solar installations account for about 27.2% of the overall renewable capacity, today, in India. The LED bulb revolution, made popular by Indian families, which saves a good Rs 19,000 crore annually, is another great example of how Modinomics is participative. These bulbs used to cost Rs 300-450 per piece in 2013, but are now available at between just Rs 34-50, per unit. That Modinomics is not isolationist like Nehru’s decadent, Mahalanobis model is evident from the Rs 43,574 crore investment by Facebook in Reliance Jio, the largest ever FDI into India, in the technology sector. Equally, the clarion call of “Vocal for Local” by PM Modi is best exemplified by the unprecedented decision to amend the “Essential Commodities Act” of 1955, yet another Nehruvian relic, well past its expiry date, to ensure deregulation of prices for food stuff including cereals, edible oils, oilseeds, pulses, onions, and potatoes. Also, allowing farmers in contract farming and defanging the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) structure, will give “adequate choices” to farmers to sell their produce at attractive prices, either via barrier-free, inter-state trade, or via e-trading, besides, of course, ending trade cartelisation by middlemen and ensuring assured returns, quality and standardisation to India’s “Annadaata”.  It is true that like the rest of the globe, India will slowdown, with the World Bank predicting a 3.2% GDP contraction for India in 2020-21, while forecasting a much larger 5.2% contraction in world GDP and an even bigger 7% contraction for advanced economies. Equally, Fitch says India’s recovery will be dramatic and its GDP will grow by a solid 9.5% in 2021-22, while S&P says, India’s growth will be the sharpest at 8.5% in 2021-22.   Well, in the case of PM Narendra Modi, last year has been extraordinary for the sheer number of opportunities that were seized, to create new milestones, in making India self-reliant. India trumped France in 2019 to become the 6th largest and then yet again surpassed the United Kingdom in early 2020, to become the world’s 5th largest economy. The Prime Minister, at the recent ICC address, quoted Swami Vivekananda, who decades back had urged Indians to “use their own products and get markets for Indian art ware in other countries”. The PM went on to say how the path shown by Swami Vivekananda is an inspiration for India in the post-COVID world. Indeed, as geopolitical equations recalibrate, India, with a forex reserve of almost $500 billion, next only to China and Japan, has shown to the world, why it deserves to enjoy pole position, in more ways than one. Modinomics, with the right degree of fortitude and unputdownable resilience, has indeed, consummately blended the 3P’s: People, Planet, and Profits.

"How WHO and its Chief compromised war against Chinese Virus which has left more than 28,000 dead", 28-Mar-2020,,"The role of China in unleasing the deadly Wuhan virus is already too well known. However, the dubious role of WHO, especially its Director-General Dr. Tedros in either shielding China or delaying the declaration of the pandemic needs a thorough investigation. China has been investing big money to buy out journalists including those from India. A report in Guardian on December 7, 2018, reveals the facts so clearly. One must read  Now let me take you a bit through the WHO boss Dr. Tedros. You should know that he is the first non-doctor (he is Dr for Ph.D.) Director-General of WHO. This all happened for his loyalty to China being health minister Ethiopia. Check this Screenshot.  Dr Tedros won the election against a well-qualified candidate despite widely covered accusations that he covered up three different cholera epidemics as health minister in Ethiopia. You may read about the controversy here. https://t.co/Pc5afUdzgr?amp=1 One must not miss what happened next. On 18 October 2017, Dr. Tedros announced that he had chosen Dictator President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, a notorious human rights violator to serve as a WHO  “Diplomats said (Mugabe’s) appointment was a political payoff from Tedros  to China, a long-time ally of Mugabe, and the 50 or so African states that helped to secure Tedros’s election earlier this year,” wrote Rebecca Myers in The Times on Oct 22, 2017. She further writes: Chinese diplomats had campaigned hard for the Ethiopian, using Beijing’s financial clout and opaque aid budget to build support for him among developing countries."" The whole report can be  CNN columnist Frida Ghitis noted in Washington Post on 26/10/17 that China worked tirelessly behind the scenes to help Tedros defeat the UK candidate Dr. David Nabarro. Tedros’s victory was also a victory for Beijing, whose leader Xi has made public his goal of flexing China’s muscle in the world.” The report for can be I am sure that what follows below has reasons above. Feb 2, 2020, WHO Chief  China’s influence in the WHO is also clearly visible in the organization’s treatment of Taiwan. Since China acceded to the UN in 1971, it has periodically blocked Taiwan’s WHO membership on the grounds that the democratically governed island is part of China. 2009-16, China allowed Taiwan to join the World Health Assembly, as an observer under the name Chinese Taipei. After the election of President Tsai Ing-wen in 2016, cross-strait relations chilled causing  One must not forget this tweet by WHO on January 14, 2020, though Taiwan had warned of the same to former on December 31, 2019.  So to put it precisely, Taiwan had warned of human-human transmission of Chinese Virus but WHO concluded with  1. WHO is an indispensable source of infos for countries’ health departments. Without a membership, Taiwan relies on China’s health dept for outbreak infos with delays & errors. 2. The WHO’s inclusion of Taiwan as part of China’s territory overstates the scale of the outbreak on the island leading to unmerited economic and diplomatic consequences. Mainland cases of #COVID2019 are now above 80,000 with over 3,300 deaths. Taiwan has 267 so far. However, multiple countries including Italy, Mongolia, Vietnam, El Salvador, and the Philippines used the WHO country classification as justification to restrict travel from Taiwan.  Let's come back to WHO's actions again. Dr. Tedros’ inaction stands in striking contrast to the WHO’s actions during the 2003 SARS outbreak (China). Then WHO DG Dr. Gro Harlem B declared the WHO’s first travel advisory in 55 years which recommended against travel to & from the disease  In contrast Dr. Tedros is an advocate for the Chinese government’s #COVID2019 response. On Jan 28, he met  Xi Jinping in Beijing & commended China for “setting a new standard for outbreak control” & praised the country’s top leadership for its“openness to sharing information”.

Leadership Surge: Landscape of Challenges and Responses in global Crisis, 29-Mar-2020,Satyendra Tripathi,"Extraordinary challenges demand extraordinary solutions and leadership quality. World at the edge of global pandemic COVID-19 is under one of the greatest threat posed to mankind in the last century. It has created fear among society and other stakeholders. The massive scale of the outbreak and its uncertainty to predict make it more challenging to respond. Indeed, the outbreak of this pandemic has challenged many social and emotional constituents across the world. Recognizing the seriousness of this pandemic prompt response from our leadership shows mature democratic which results in the proper estimation of both the possibility of this crisis and the impact that it could have. An existential crisis is facing the society, whole of nature, life, shape and future of humanity is at stake. It is high time for the leadership too to show extraordinary measures in limiting the crisis. At the domestic level, India has shown exemplary leadership in dealing with this global challenge. As a precautionary step towards ensuring health security, Indian Prime Minister called for ‘Janta Curfew’ a very innovative way of a citizen-led lockdown for ensuring social distancing to curb the transmission of the virus. While the medical success of the call in flattening the curve can be estimated only later, what it did show is that the country came together as one unit across religious, political and caste lines, setting a new high for democracies. In a very encouraging step to appreciate those engaged in combating COVID-19, PM urged the citizens to express their gratitude towards those in the first line of defense by applauding from the balconies or terraces of their houses for 5 minutes. To generate awareness, India is also utilizing popular social Media platforms like WhatsApp to create awareness about the coronavirus pandemic and has urged social media services to tackle the spread of misinformation on their platforms. But at the same time we are here, and we are facing another crisis, and we are hungry for whatever the past can teach us about how to survive moments of great stress and strain. India has taken many steps to deal with challenges that will emerge after and during the nation-wide lockdown. In this India has announced US$2.1 billion aid for those in the healthcare sector. Also to ensure social security and inclusion government had announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore relief package aimed at providing a safety net for those hit hardest by the Covid-19 lockdown, along with insurance cover for frontline medical personnel. About 800 million people will get free cereals and cooking gas apart from cash through direct transfers for three months. The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana includes higher wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Act (MGNREGA), Rs 1,000 ex-gratia payment to nearly 30 million poor senior citizens, widows and disabled as well as insurance coverage of as much as Rs 50 lakh each for about 2 million healthcare workers battling the disease. States have been asked to use the Building and Construction Workers Welfare Fund to provide relief to construction workers. The first instalment of Rs 2,000 under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana will be frontloaded to reach 87 million farmers in April. Reasserting India’s leadership once again by convening a video conference of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) states to collectively rein in the threat of COVID-19 can be seen as a thoughtful drive to respond to China’s growing influence in the region. It is being seen as a good geopolitical move and timely initiative as COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-nCoV-2 virus, has created widespread concerns in South Asian countries. These countries are starting to suffer a widespread cessation of economic activity due to fears of this deadly virus. India has taken the regional initiative, and we are helping each other across the land and maritime border, from providing medicines to testing protocols and protective gear (PPE). India pledged $10 million toward a COVID-19 emergency fund and it also announced that it would be putting together a team of specialists for the SAARC states. The fund has so far collected $15 million after Nepal, Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also came forward with contributions for the initiative. In this global crisis once again, Leaders of the Group of 20 or G20 major economies, have shown greater pledged to infuse over $5 trillion into the global economy, and do “whatever it takes” to minimize the economic and social impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. In a joint statement issued after the G-20’s first-ever virtual summit, chaired by Saudi Arabia, members committed themselves to restore global growth, maintaining market stability and strengthening resilience. “We are injecting over $5 trillion into the global economy, as part of a targeted fiscal policy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, being economic and financial impacts of the pandemic. We will continue to conduct bold and large-scale fiscal support. Collective G20 action will amplify its impact, ensure coherence, and harness synergies. The magnitude and scope of this response will get the global economy back on its feet, and set a strong basis for the protection of jobs and the recovery of growth,” the statement said. The crisis staring us in the face has also posed another question for humankind to reflect upon. Our lives have slowed down to a great extent, if popular reports are to be believed the Ozone hole over Antarctic has started to heal and Delhi’s air Quality has improved to below 70 PPM after months of being in the hazardous zone. However, what remains for us to see is what will shape the future of the generations to come. Will Social Distancing and Work from Home become the new normal? Winston Churchill had once remarked, “The future is unknowable, but the past should give us hope”. Memories of a past with no lockdowns, and memories of those who lost the battle against COVID 19 give us a hope of a future with normalcy. The very future of society now lies on the pillars of human adaptability and revised societal structures driven by technology.

‘Don’t link repatriation of Chinese with the border situation’ says China; CPC mouthpiece downplays the 'escalation of the border disputes' news reports #IndiaChinaStandoff, 27-May-2020,,"Amid media reports over the escalating border tensions between India and China, China slammed Indian media outlets for fueling a new round of irresponsible speculation that China may be preparing for an escalation of the border disputes. The Chinese Embassy in India has announced that it would arrange special flights for its citizens that are willing to fly home from India. Some media outlets had interpreted it as an escalation of the fresh border tensions between the two countries. Condemning the reports by some Indian media, China has clarified that the repatriation of its citizens is a normal service provided by the embassy and said, ‘it is far-fetched and misguided to link the embassy's normal response with the border situation, which will do nothing but exacerbate distrust and antipathy toward China among the Indian public.’ “The voluntary repatriation plan should be seen as a normal service provided by the embassy to its citizens. Yet, some Indian media outlets have intentionally linked the normal operation to the recent border tension between China and India in the Galwan Valley region, fueling a new round of irresponsible speculation that China may be preparing for an escalation of the border disputes,” said Global Times, a tabloid under the auspices of the Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper. The CPC mouthpiece said that any attempt to deepen the misunderstanding between the two countries' peoples is extremely inappropriate at present. “China clearly has no intention of escalating the border disputes with India, so its assistance to its citizens should not be over-interpreted. China-India relations have been developing in a zig-zag pattern due to the complicated geopolitical situation, and the border issue may only be one of their problems. However, that should not change the overall improvement of their bilateral economic and trade ties,” it added.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/27/CPC-mouthpiece-slams-irresponsible-Indian-media.html

The news release also raises grave concerns on the collective repression of the population, especially religious and ethnic minorities, in Tibet and Xinjiang. They further highlight the suppression of Corona virus whistle-blowers like Dr Li Wenliang who were shamed and targeted in China. The experts expressed concerns that “journalists, medical workers and those exercising their right to free speech online in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak and pandemic have allegedly faced retaliation from the authorities, including many being charged with 'spreading misinformation' or 'disrupting public order'”. The UN independent experts have called for “renewed attention on the human rights situation in the country, particularly in light of the moves against the people of the Hong Kong, minorities of the Xinjiang, illegally occupied Tibet and human rights defenders across the country.” In conclusion, the UN experts call on the “international community to act collectively and decisively to ensure China respects human rights and abides by its international obligations.” Non-coperation of China It can be recalled that China has repeatedly refused to allow access to UN independent experts for official visits to ascertain the Human Rights in the regions under its occupation. It had also not agreed independent investigatiors from US and Australia to investigate into the origins of Corona virus in Wuhan. In the last 10 years, only five experts were permitted to visit China and not a single one to Tibet. Given this high-handed attitude of China, the UN experts urged the Chinese government to invite the UN independent experts to visit, monitor, and report on the ground realities.

Erdogan’s tirade against Israel a sheer hypocrisy, 07-Sep-2020,Jagdish N Singh,"It is heartening to note that there has hardly been any subaltern level protest in the Arab world over the recent establishment of diplomatic ties between the United Arab Emirates and the Jewish State of Israel. A prominent Middle East observer says that protests, even among ordinary Palestinians, have been minuscule. Peoples in the Arab world are no longer ‘clamouring’ for any false pan-Arab / pan-Islamic unity. One would suggest Abu Dhabi and Jerusalem must use this atmosphere to focus on the all-inclusive peace, welfare, development, education, and equality in the region. Besides, the two capitals must invest in neutralising the influence whatever of the elements, such as Hamas, the Palestinian Authority, the grand mufti of Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque, Muslim Brotherhood, the Iranian regime and the Turkish presidency, which have been highly critical of the UAE-Israel peace treaty.  Knowledgeable sources say Ankara’s diplomatic conduct under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan amounts to sheer hypocrisy. Apparently, Turkish supremo supports the Islamic Movement within Israel. He presents himself as a defender of the Palestinians and their al-Aqsa Mosque. Turkey today hosts Hamas operatives against Israel. In line with this,  President  Erdogan has threatened to cut his country’s ties with the UAE over the latter’s peace treaty with Israel. His spokesman   Ibrahim Kalin said, ""History will not forget those who betray the Palestinian people and sell out the Palestinian cause….Turkey will continue to stand by the Palestinian people."" But Ankara itself has had a special relationship with Jerusalem. Contemporary history bears out Turkey was neutral during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. Turkey was the first Muslim state to establish diplomatic ties with Israel way back in  1949. Since then it has long been highly accommodative of Israel. In 1951, Turkey joined the Western powers to protest against Egypt’s decision to deny Israeli ships passage through the Suez Canal. In 1954, then Turkish Premier Adnan Menderes called on Arab states to recognize Israel. In 1958, Israeli leaders David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir, along with their then IDF Chief of Staff,  landed in Istanbul on a historic secret mission aimed at enhancing cultural and intelligence cooperation between Jerusalem and Ankara. The Mossad opened its station in Turkey in the early 1950s.

Untold story of Invasion and Destruction of Tibet by Communist China, 03-Jun-2020,,"The Physical Invasion It includes deadly plots, which it shouldn't have. It includes conspiracies, economic ambitions, which it shouldn't include. It includes murders in masses, which should have been out of the question! Because it is Tibet we're talking about, it is Buddhism we're referring to, and it is the world's forbidden city we're calling out to. All this started getting buried in the past, centuries ago, but the suffering took an even more dreadful shape in the 19th century by the great empire of 'The Republic Of China'. It seemed the law of jungle still prevailed. The bigger fish goes on eating, the smaller fish – no protest. Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong etc., the list of the countries is long but well in the clutches of the Republic. To understand what causes the Chinese to be so anxious and ambitious to gain lands and grow, can only be understood through their mindsets which are ruled by many historical state of affairs that came their way moulding them into who they are today. It also becomes essential to understand this for the futures to come and to understand what to expect. According to the New York Times report, the three points that the Chinese leaders give their people, which makes them strive for more than others, and to see the world through a narrow mindset are, first, 100 years of humiliation by the western imperialists, second, ten years of unrest under the Cultural Revolution, third, 25 years of an economic miracle under reforms and openness introduced by Denzin Xiaoping. The first two creates isolation from the west and the world, whereas the third glorifies the self-made efforts for reforms rather than trusting the country with anyone else. 'Fear of chaos has developed conservatism and the nation's shrewd ambitions.' As researched by The College of Staten Island's Modern China Studies Group, Chinese people are consumed by anxiety about more mundane issues. As one popular saying in China goes, ""the reform on the state-owned enterprises is to keep you off work, the housing reform is to empty your pocket, the educational reform is to drive your parents crazy, and the medical health reform is to send you to the grave ahead of time."" This showcases how the Chinese community looks at the world beyond their borders. The Cultural Invasion Pragmatism, meritocracy, Confucianism, historical longevity, population, individual specialization, etc., and many others are terms that lead to one another in Chinese social and political mindsets. The baseline being lots of competition. It is very well put up by an old Chinese citizen 'You have to maximize your maximization so that you can keep your advantages and get more.' Continuing which, they put through that 'when you grow up with that kind of continual tug-of-war of your advantages vs anybody else's advantages, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the whole modus vivendi of that; it just carries over to any other part of life. And when a couple of million others have grown up in the same way, that attitude and outlook become self-reinforcing and self-propagating.' The above paragraphs form perfect justifications to what Chinese have been doing with Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau and now Taiwan. We live in a world of cooperation, rights and identities which are and must be respected. Living in historical speculations and eras managed by a few leaders can only lead to one thing, that is, the end of the present and the future. This is the way China did gain the body of Tibet but lost its soul; it gained the beautiful lands of Tibet but lost Buddhism, the highest attraction. The reason behind is the materialistic beliefs because that is where they compete. What do I want, what is most beneficial to my conscious self, what do I want now, tomorrow, and 20 years from now. Strategically and practically are the moves planned by the Chinese. They put a lot of emphasis on what they call 'reality'. But one of the highest religion Buddhism emphasizes long term questions like, ""what after death, the meaning of existence.' Something which cannot be proved by shrewd business strategies and experiments because the short term questions they are focused on, for examples is 'What about my grandchild?'  No wonder the understanding of Buddhism was out of the question for them and appeared loss-making to them. But, the Chinese were intelligent enough to get through their ultimate goal of 'unification' in steps starting from the 1950s and ending with the total takeover in 1959 by striking an ideological debate. The idea was to end Buddhist ideology through the slow poison of leaving them uneducated and firing 'thamzing' (Class struggle). Camouflaging their crimes The starting incidents can make you laugh but also strike right on the problem of Chinese materialistic ideology! When in 1953 a group of 10 Chinese soldiers in Khaki arrived in Sakya, Tibet, they were shown disapproval by the local people clapping and cursing which was a common way of dogpa (negation of evil). The soldiers, rather than understanding the insult, joined them in clapping, amazed by the welcome they had just received! It was a thing to wonder for them that insult and disapproval can also be so peaceful and non-violent. The red materialism was far away from such phenomena. Series of diplomatic steps were taken intelligently by the Chinese to gain sympathy and feeling for the Republic. Some of which included gaining the trust of Aristocrats and the upper-class people after the Seventeen point agreement (1951) which gave Tibet the freedom to be autonomous. The aristocrats were promised their power and status would prevail forever even after the reforms take place, and it might as well increase. These people were chosen for special tours to the industrialized regions of China for them to return, impressed by the Red form of governance.  The irony is that communism was built with great respect for labourers, daily wage workers, lower class common people but rather the communist state was using factors and people to fulfil its ambitions against which and whom, it had stood up for once: aristocracy. Flaws are inevitable. Tibetan cities were divided into teams of underemployed Chinese officials. Criminals of Tibet who would work with cruelty were employed as heads of these groups as they were offered positions to pay off old scores. Slow poisoning Seventeen point agreement in 1951: Tibetans were handed over materialistic freedom by the Chinese giving them political and cultural freedom in an autonomous region. Unaware that Tibetan independence was always based more on their life and culture than the law and history. The economic condition of the peasants and herdsmen of the non-communist state of Tibet was far better than the ROC. Maybe this became one of the reasons why labourers were not focused on for ideological transformations as it seemed practically impossible to show a better system than the one prevalent in Tibet for them.  The next set of transformation lot(group) after the aristocrats started hanging Mao's clay statues in their homes secretly, no need to mention how influenced they were, came the young minds when in 1956 blue coloured uniformed personnel came to Tibet to open 'Red Schools', and to start youth organizations while politely asking Tibetans to merge traditional schools with these. Of course, the first to admit were the children of the aristocrats and ruling class of Tibet, going well with Pecking's (Beijing till 1979) strategy of the ruling class being made to play an important role in bringing up a peaceful revolution. Almost all the local rulers unconsciously supported this backstabbing strategy, unaware of what they are yet to see. The aristocrats were paid for their patriotism and cooperation. The labourers were paid to build the military road for the Chinese, and not shockingly children were paid to attend the red school monthly. All these incidents and practices are stark opposite to what the red book stands for. The silver dollars' da Yuan' exchanged pockets in Tibet to build 'silver dollar road' from Beijing to Tibet. The most intelligent among the people from Tibet were undoubtedly the peasants, labourers and the common man who was doubtful from the beginning and dismissed the new idea, though still working for the 'da Yuan'. They did not give in their ideology. Subjugation, Divide and rule History does repeat itself. The way labourers and common men fought against the aristocrats to develop a classless society, the warrior tribe of Tibet, Khampas, in turn, fought against the Chinese for their freedom. The shift is clear, and the ideology of the red book appears more flawed than ever. After this began the backstabbing by the Chinese, starting with the aristocrats and high-class people who were the first one to be used. They were thrown to the jails after calling them on the pretext of attending an educational programme. But opposite to that, the leaders were captured on the charge of treason. This disarmed the local people of their leaders for the Chinese to introduce the reforms of 'unification' finally. After this is what began the 'the dark time'. Tibet was invaded, pillaged, raped, and destroyed. It had no armies, no weapons, no tanks, but their monasteries were robbed, priceless historical and religious scriptures burned, monks tortured, and nuns raped before being murdered. Tibetans were forced not to meditate, but to work in the fields. It was a common and painful site for the Tibetans to see llamas carrying wastes and excreta to manure the Chinese fields instead of the beautiful sites of them chanting 'Om Mani Padme hum' or silently meditating. This is an example of one of the greatest violation of human rights and freedom of a human. Soon, the cities were divided into various teams of underemployed Chinese officials, and it should not be shocking at this point, the criminals of Tibet were employed as head of the groups. They were offered such positions to pay off old scores and no doubt, they then worked precisely the way they were told, with cruelty. At this point, the first point of Chinese competitive and anxious nature, with what we started, comes into play. To develop such competitive feelings, they were unable to use the three points of history for Tibetans. Still, they made different teams among the cities to compete with one another declaring and awarding the most patriotic and hardworking labour and humiliating the last. The creation of China's artificial copy has been in process. Vilifying the belief system Tibetan Religion was called poison; their gods were referred to as ""mud images"" and the holy monks as bloodsuckers. After all such preaching, Tibetans were told they have freedom for religion! This showcases that Buddhism was slow poisoned, the process of which is still on. As the children got gradually educated, the ideology of atheism was attempted to seep deep down into them. The life since then in the most peaceful lands of the world has narrowed down to only two things: Beijing's re-education policy and hard labour. This continues in the present with the least international support for the Forbidden City. No doubt no country stood up actively opposing this grave and open human rights violation happening because it is a little of Gold, Uranium and other metals plentiful in those previously closed lands. With this I repeat - It seems the law of jungle still prevails, the bigger fish goes on eating, the smaller fish – no protest. This fight with Tibet started ideologically, which witnessed a considerable number of ironies to communism. No other example I believe captures its imperfections best than the sacrifice of one peaceful nation. The baseline remains that materialism doesn't succumb to any ideology and never will it in the future. What always rules and should is one's freedom to choice and independence of lands, and this demands international unity above matter and money as both of them must complement peace and not separate the two.

The Pathbreaking verdict, 21-Jul-2020,,"The  historic verdict by the SC bench has corrected the wrongs set by the Division Bench of Kerala High Court which had failed to notice that the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its properties remained vested in the presiding deity The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, in a path breaking judgment set aside the Kerala High Court judgment which denied any role to the Travancore Royal family in the Padmanabha Swami temple administration. On July 19, 1991, Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, who had executed the Covenant as Ruler of the Covenanting State of Travancore, passed away. Since then, his successor, Uthradam Thirunal Marthanda Varma had been exercising all functions as “Ruler of Travancore” with respect to the affairs of the Temple till the Judgment was passed by the High Court in the present case. The Kerala High Court made some interesting observations and concluded that the treasures in the storage rooms need to be exhibited in a museum to be set up in the premises of temple, which will give a major boost to the tourism. The Kerala High Court disposed of the petition with the direction to the state to immediately take steps to constituted body corporate or trust or or other legal authority to take control of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple its assets and to manage and run the same in accordance with the traditions.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/21/The-Pathbreaking-verdict.html

The Green World Order: India could be a Leader, 30-Sep-2020,-Dr Manoj Sinha & Dr Satish Kumar,"The world is sitting on the brink on catastrophe. Neither America nor China is keen to safeguard the world through its roadmap of the Green World Order There has been much talk of the shifting of power from West to East. The rise of China, along with India and Japan, was flared up that the 21st Century is destined to be an Asian century. But there are many disruptions. Will China become a superpower in the same status as Britain and America controlled the International system? One of the thinkers of world politics, Richard Haass explained that a superpower needs to have besides economic and military powers an ability to intervene politically in any part of the world and prove its unparalleled strength. Another qualification is to use nuclear weapons and its reach out across the globe. China flatly fails on both the parameters as a superpower. The second disruptions against the rising China theory are that more than two powers are emerging on the landscape of the International System. The concept of Middle Powers like India, Germany, Japan, South Africa, and few more are inching up to shape the world system together. Chinese aggressions in many parts of Asia are showing her utter desperations to become the unparalleled power in the region.

Political Callisthenics in Didi’s Poschimbanga, 26-Sep-2020,-Dr Mrittunjoy Guha Majumdar,"The tragedy in West Bengal today is that the claims of the government and the reality on the ground are often miles apart. This is especially true when it comes to employment in the State. Mamata Banerjee and the TMC came to power on a strong anti-incumbency wave against the communists and her promises of changing the State, bringing in infrastructure, jobs and opportunities. Almost a decade after she came to power, while Didi lauds Bengal’s unemployment rate for being lower than the national average and attributes it to her government’s economic strategies, we hear stories such as the heartwrenching one wherein a daily labourer and his wife sold their two-and-a-half month daughter for Rs 3000 to face the financial burdens they faced with joblessness and laborers from the State have to risk their lives and work in far-flung states and union territories like Jammu and Kashmir to earn a living. Why is there a gap between what is projected by Didi, and what is the reality on the ground? As per the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), West Bengal is India’s sixth-largest State in terms of economic size. As per the data compiled using information from Directorate of Economics & Statistics of the State Governments as reported to MOSPI, West Bengal had a Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Rs. 11.78 trillion in 2018-2019 as on March 15, 2020. The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) has been developing WBIDC Parks (with such Parks existing in Raghunathpur—Purulia, Vidyasagar Industrial Park—Kharagpur, Poly Park and Food Park—Sankrail, Kandua, Paridhan Garments Park and Shilpangan Light Engineering Park in Kolkata, Manikanchan Gems and Jewellery Park in Kolkata, Naihati, Kalyani, Haldia Industrial Park, Barjora and Durgapur) and WBIDC Industrial Growth Centres (in Dabgram, Raninagar, Chakchaka, Bhabuk, Bolpur, Haringhata, Bishnupur, Uluberia, Falta, Haldia Growth Centre and Kharagpur Growth Centre) to encourage medium and large-scale industries. The primary functional SEZs in the State are Unitech Hi-tech Structures Ltd. Rajarhat in Kolkata—IT/ITES, DLF IT SEZ Rajarhat in Kolkata—IT/ITES, Bengal Gem And Jewellery Park (Salt Lake) in Kolkata—Jewellery manufacturing and studies, WIPRO SEZ (Salt Lake Sector V) in Kolkata—IT/ITES, Falta Special Economic Zone in Falta—Multi-product, Kolkata IT park in Bantala—IT and TCS Gitanjali Park—IT/ITES. These facts and figures may present a rosy picture, but the reality on the ground is grim when it comes to industries. Much like in the days of Communist rule, when right from alley-way Dadas to local satraps with clout, the presence of muscle power was a major cause of concern for citizens, industries and society, the TMC rule has seen cases like when IFB Agro Industries Ltd, a listed company with national presence and one of India’s biggest distiller and spirit-makers, saw its Noorpur facility in West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district vandalised (besides its employees being attacked) by a group of 150 ‘armed’ goons, leading to the closure of the facility. The extortion culture that prevailed in the days of the CPI(M) government in West Bengal still continues to this day. When I hear stories about my grandfather—Dhirendranath Guha Majumdar, who was a pioneer in the Durgapur Steel Plant Project as well as various other engineering projects in the early days of independent India, I wonder—where has that Bengal gone? Until a few decades ago, West Bengal had a number of industries, be it textiles, chemicals or engineering parts. Over the 80s and 90s, Naxalism, industrial unrest and the Bandh culture have made major companies such as Shaw Wallace, ICI India, Philips India, Brooke Bond India and JK Tyres leave the State. The scourge of Dadagiri, the extortion culture and violence (West Bengal reported the maximum number of political murders in 2018 as per a report by the National Crime Records Bureau) has dissuaded prospective investors from steering clear from a state where the law and order situation has been dismal. In such a scenario, it is the informal sector as well as Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) that have to accommodate a major section of the unemployed masses in the State, albeit at low wages and with job insecurity. Not only have the efforts of the West Bengal Government not matched the need for more investment into MSMEs, but Mamata Banerjee went on to criticise the central government’s Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) for MSMEs recently! In 2016, the state government had launched Startup Bengal to encourage the establishment of MSMEs. However, between January 1, 2016, and April 30 2018, the State Government had provided financial incentives to only 15 start-ups. The State Government seems to be so aloof of the severity of the problem in various sectors that even during times of crisis, such as during the COVID lockdown, there have been violations of the directive by the Union Ministry of Labour and Employment to companies around wage cuts and job terminations, in banks, jute mills and tea gardens in West Bengal. When Mamata Banerjee talks of unemployment in West Bengal being among the lowest in the country and job employment among the highest, I must highlight that West Bengal has always been on the upper end of the employment spectrum in recent decades. The World Bank highlighted that this has been the case since 2005, well before the CPI (M) was ousted from power. While the State has been doing well in job growth (thanks to manufacturing and construction), the State has only one in five workers in a salaried job. Moreover, the female labour participation in the State is very low. Mamata Banerjee’s has been a government of contradictions: she speaks of federalism but does not want to share COVID data with the Union Government; she speaks of secularism but her pandering to Muslim orthodoxy has even made Muslim women turn away from the TMC; she used to speak against a ‘culture of violence’ propagated by CPI (M) in the State and yet her party is using the exact same tricks of the trade that the Communists did before them The Government in West Bengal has not only attracted scrutiny from the enforcement directorate lately but also sounds hypocritical when criticising the Central Government for the privatisation of PSUs. At the same time, it goes about undertaking questionable disinvestment pursuits, such as in the Metro Dairy sale where the ED summoned 4 top IAS officers of the Mamata Government. Corruption and bribery make matters worse for the government in the State, with about 46% people in West Bengal admitting to have given bribes to get their work done in a nationwide survey last year. Earlier in the year, several TMC Panchayat members and workers were held responsible for misappropriation of cyclone Amphan relief-funds in Nandigram in East Midnapore district. An interesting tidbit here is that the violence in Nandigram in 2007 was a key development that sounded the death-knell of the CPI(M) government in the State and led to the rise of the TMC. Will this new incident of corruption in Nandigram sound the death-knell for the TMC in the State? This is not the first time when the TMC has found itself under intense scrutiny for allegations of corruption. Previously, Mathew Samuel bravely came out as the whistleblower in the Narada News sting operation, where members of the ruling party in the State were recorded accepting bribes in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. In the Rose Valley Group and Saradha Group Ponzi schemes, around Rs 17,500 crore is estimated to have been duped from investors. In both cases, the TMC has been accused of inaction. In the Rose Valley Group and Saradha Group Ponzi schemes, around Rs 17,500 crore is estimated to have been duped from investors. In both cases, the TMC has been accused of inaction. Moreover, the directors of both the money-pooling companies have ties to the Trinamool Congress. The erstwhile CEO of the group’s media wing Kunal Ghosh was himself a Rajya Sabha TMC Member of Parliament Moreover, the directors of both the money-pooling companies have ties to the Trinamool Congress. The erstwhile CEO of the group’s media wing Kunal Ghosh was himself a Rajya Sabha TMC Member of Parliament. However, the most pressing matter of concern is the fact that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee herself feigned ignorance about Saradha being a chit fund company even after the then-Union Minister of Company Affairs Sachin Pilot had placed a list of 73 companies from West Bengal who were running Ponzi schemes in the floor of the house in the Lok Sabha, earlier in the year, in March 2013. These Ponzi schemes may, however, be only the tip of the iceberg. Data collated by the All-India Small Depositors’ Association (AISDA) from agents of 27 money pooling companies has shown that these companies collectively raised close to Rs 40,000 crore in the last four years West Bengal. The depositors in such funds included small-time depositors from rural and semi-urban areas. Self-help groups (SHGs) formed to secure microcredit from rural banks were also being used to spread such Ponzi schemes among the group members. This is particularly worrying due to the limited purchasing power of citizens in rural and semi-urban pockets across the State today. As of 2017, West Bengal had 1.5 crore unorganised-sector workers, mainly in areas such as construction. With the housing market in Kolkata on the downslide and new state-based real-estate regulations (the West Bengal government bypassed the central government’s Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act—RERA with its own Housing Industry Regulation Act—HIRA), the workers employed as daily wage labourers are finding it tough to earn a living. Without trade unions to intercede for such workers, to put pressure on the government to revise wage rates based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Wholesale Price Index (WPI) movements, the government does not bother to look more closely at ways to resolve this looming problem. As a result, thousands employed in the unorganised sector (as well as the organised sector) are at the mercy of the market. There is a communication gap between the state government and various industrial units, as seen all too clearly in the non-payment of wages in the Jute industry. An interesting point here is that one of the most common reasons given by mainstream media for the industrial downslide in West Bengal is labour militancy. This is, however, no longer true. As per the Statistical Appendix of the Economic Review 2011-12 (Government of West Bengal),  while in 1980, the total number of industrial disputes involving strikes was 78, the total number of such disputes decreased to 15 in 2010. However, factors like low labour productivity in West Bengal, concerning labour productivity in the rest of India, maybe greater driving factors on this front. Regardless, the efforts to survive without any meaningful direction to do so has historically resulted in some workers establishing contact with syndicates within cities. These syndicates are usually run by local strongmen who have connections with the ruling party, and keep a check on the supply of government contracts and construction-related work. These syndicates today are widespread from real-estate to Durga Pujas, and resort to arm-twisting if a customer does not acquiesce to their demands. Unlike cartels, these syndicates operate brazenly in the open and often with the collusion of the local administration. A recent expose by India Today showed how everyone, from a TMC councillor to the chairman of a Municipalit, were embroiled in the tangle of syndicates. If the scourge of syndicates was not enough, the investment proposals shared by the government that never get fructified make matters worse for a population struggling with unemployment. West Bengal managed to garner investment proposals of Rs 2.84 lakh crore, with proposed plans and projects announced by major corporate such as Reliance, JSW Group, ITC, Flipkart, and Coca Cola, during 2019. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has also shared the plans for her ‘Silicon Valley’ in New Town, with companies such as Reliance Jio and TCS already having taken up land in the proposed hub. At the end of each edition of the annual Bengal Global Business Summit (from 2015 to 2018), announcements of the scale of investment proposals and expressions of interest were announced: Rs 2.43 lakh crore in 2015, Rs 2.5 lakh crore in 2016, Rs 2.35 lakh crore in 2017 and 2.19 lakh crore in 2018. But, the latest conclave in December 2019 did not see such an announcement. This is not surprising since, between 2015 and 2018 several proposals, investment intentions, expressions of interests and specific announcements have been in the news, with a net amount of Rs 9.47 lakh crore being highlighted, albeit the State Government’s response on how much of this amount and investment has actually fructified is not forthcoming. I believe this is because the State does not have much to report, with a dearth of foundation-laying or expansion-cum-diversification events. The last major investment project in the State was of over Rs 16,000 crore in the modernisation and expansion of the integrated steel plant of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) in Burnpur, between 2006 and 2015. Some industrial bigwigs highlight how Mamata’s confused approach to land acquisition (understandably so, since here preceding Chief Minister lost his seat primarily due to forced land acquisition in Singur and Nandigram) may be playing a role in dissuading investors from walking the talk. Not only has she horribly failed in bringing new investments and projects but has also not succeeded in reopening labour-intensive units of Jessop, Hindustan Motors and Dunlop, among others, which have been lying closed for a number of years now. Not only has the TMC Government proven to be inept in doing much on the economic front but they have also horrendously miscalculated on what I see as appeasement-based politics on the ground. Be it her over-the-top reactions on ‘Jai Shri Ram’ chants in May 2019, the rise of radical figures like the ‘Fatwa Man of Bengal’ Noor-ur-Rehman Barkati who famously promised to pay anyone who blackened PM Modi’s face and has graced Trinamool Congress rallies in the past, the state government curtailing the time traditionally permitted for the immersion of Durga idols to allow a break for Eid in 2016 and subsequently restricting idol immersion on Dashami day beyond 6 PM in 2017, militant outfits like Harkat-ul-Jehadi Islami (HUJI) spreading their tentacles deep into the countryside, frivolous tactics like the West Bengal Council of Higher Education (WBCHE) replacing the Bengali word for rainbow—Ramdhenu (Ram’s Bow) with Rongdhenu (bow of colours) and the persecution of patriotic citizens like Padma Shri Kazi Masum Akhtar by fundamentalists in the State when he asked his students to sing the national anthem, all point to a worrying descent of the State into a pit of appeasement-based politics, communalism and intolerance. The extent of appeasement was visible when even an assertive Muslim leader like Asaduddin Owaisi said,` […] she is looking down to Muslims of the State as human indicators of Muslims are very low in the State. Please stop appeasing Muslims for vote’, and when Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar accused Didi of “explicit appeasement” of the minority community. Mamata Banerjee’s has been a government of contradictions: she speaks of federalism but does not want to share COVID data with the Union government; she speaks of secularism, but her pandering to Muslim orthodoxy has even made Muslim women turn away from the TMC; she used to speak against a ‘culture of violence’ propagated by CPI(M) in the State and yet her party is using the exact same tricks of the trade that the communists did before them. The occurrences mentioned above and realities in West Bengal make me feel that Didi may just have lost the plot when it comes to administering the State. It may be time for Didi and TMC to pass the baton, for meaningful Poriborton (পরিবর্তন)—change, to initiate a new chapter in the journey of my Shonar Bangla (সোনার বাংলা)—my golden Bengal!

Hindutva and its Judicial Interpretation: A Chronological Development, 31-Jul-2020,,"Hindutva remains a hotly debated subject for a considerable time. While every individual is free to have personal opinions on the subject, the concept of Hindutva has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as well. While we discuss its tryst with judiciary and how it has been judicially interpreted, the concept has to be understood with the chronologically developing social and political context surrounding the issue. The expression ‘Hindutva’ can be traced back to Chandranath Basu’s book titled Hindutva (tattva meaning reality). The expression gained popularity after a pamphlet was published by VD Savarkar written during incarceration originally under the title ‘Essentials Of Hindutva’ in 1923 and later retitled as ‘Hindutva: Who Is a Hindu?’ when reprinted in 1928. India obtained Independence in 1947 and adopted the Constitution fully in 1950 which granted a fundamental freedom to practice religion and barred discrimination on the ground of religion. Indian National Congress (INC) was the leading national political party then and shortly in 1951 Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS) was formed by Shyama Prasad Mukherjee. First Lok Sabha elections were conducted in 1952 and INC dominated the political scenario countrywide for many subsequent years. Interestingly, the symbol of the original Congress Party during elections held between 1952 and 1971 was an image of two bullocks with a plough. INC split later on into INC(R) and INC(O). The symbol of INC(R) during the 1971–1977 period was a cow with a suckling calf. Many cow slaughter prevention/protection laws came around this period. This was also to attract Hindu voters.  In between in 1966, Shiv Sena was formed by Bal Thackrey. Both Shiv Sena and BJS affirmed their views with certain differences on Hindutva. The word ‘secular’ was not a part of the preamble to the Constitution initially. In Nain Sukh Das v State of U.P., [AIR 1953 SC 384] the Supreme Court held that the constitutional mandate against religious discrimination extended to political rights. In 1962, the Supreme Court expressed its views on the secular nature of the Constitution for the first time in Sardar Taheruddin Syedna Saheb v. State of Bombay in the judgment of Ayyangar J. In 1966, a 5- judge bench of the Supreme Court through Chief Justice Gajendra Gadkar in ‘Sastri Yagnapurushadji’ case [1966 SCR (3) 242] gave the first judicial observation on this issue. It observed that “When we think of the Hindu religion, we find it difficult, if not impossible, to define Hindu religion or even adequately describe it. Unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any one prophet; it does not worship any one God, it does not subscribe to any one dogma; it does not believe in any one philosophic concept; it does not follow any one set of religious rites or performances; in fact, it does not appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features of any religion or creed....”.  It was categorically found that it may broadly be described as a way of life and nothing more. On 24.04.1973, in Kesavananda Bharati the Supreme Court reiterated that secularism was a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Enumerating the basic features of the Constitution, Sikri, CJ named “secular character of the Constitution” as one of them. Shelat and Grover, JJ stated that “secular and federal character of the Constitution” were among the main ingredients of the basic structure enumerated therein. Jaganmohan Reddy, J,  stated clearly that “Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship” could not be amended at any cost as they are part of the basic features of the Constitution. After Keshavananda Bharati’s judgment, Indira Gandhi sought to control the judiciary and the three senior judges who wrote the majority opinion (Shelat, Grover and Hegde JJ) were dramatically superseded and Justice AN Ray was made the Chief Justice of India. Indira Gandhi repeated herself after few years when Justice HR Khanna who in his minority dissent opined in the A.D.M Jabalpur case that fundamental rights cannot be suspended during Emergency, was also superseded. When we think of the Hindu religion, we find it difficult, if not impossible, to define Hindu religion or even adequately describe it. Unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any one prophet; it does not worship any one God, it does not subscribe to any one dogma In 1975, the Allahabad High Court nullified the election of Indira Gandhi for indulging in corrupt practices and disqualified her from contesting elections for 6 years. After the Supreme Court granted only a conditional stay, in June 1975, Emergency was imposed upon countrymen by INC-led Indira Gandhi Government. It was during Emergency that the constitution was amended vide the 42nd amendment and the expression ‘secular’ was inserted in the Preamble.  In between, the Supreme Court in R Sridharan’s case [1976 (Sup) SCR 478] held that Hinduism embraces within self so many diverse forms of beliefs, faiths, practices and worships that it is difficult to define term ‘Hindu’ with precision.  Post Emergency (1977), BJS merged with several other parties to form the Janta Party & it defeated the incumbent INC in the 1977 elections. After enjoying 3 years in power, the Janata Party was dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile BJS convening to form the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP). The 7th Lok Sabha elections were conducted in January 1980 & Indira Gandhi again became the Prime Minister. Immediately within 3 days from 16.02.1980, Legislative Assemblies of 9 States – Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Orissa were dissolved by the then President Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy who acted on the advice of Indira Gandhi. Reddy earlier had served as Minister in Indira Gandhi-led Govt. These State Governments were dismissed in spite of leaders including Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, M.G. Ramachandran, Sharad Pawar, Prakash Singh Badal, Babu Banarasi Das enjoying majority support in their respective Assemblies. Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 in the aftermath of Operation Blue Star and her son Rajiv Gandhi was engaged as the leader of INC. The BJP & Shiv Sena, continued with the issue of Hindutva and the issue of Ram Janmabhoomi Temple at Ayodhya, became an important issue gradually. This led to seeking and casting of votes in the name of ‘Hindutva’.  In 1985, elections were held to the Karnataka State Legislative Assembly & the Janata Dal won. RK Hegde became the Chief Minister. Due to his resignation in 1988, S.R. Bommai became the Chief Minister. Inter-party political aspirations collided & few members of Janta Dal deflected leading to imposition of President’s Rule in the State. The Governor of the State then was Pendekanti Venkatasubbaiah, who was earlier a minister in both Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi Govts. The President then was R.Venkataraman who also served earlier as INC’s cabinet minister under Indira & Rajiv Gandhi. Venkatasubbaiah refused to give Bommai an opportunity to test his majority in the Assembly. This was despite the latter presenting him with a copy of the resolution passed by the Janata Dal Legislature Party. Bommai challenged the same which ultimately reached the doors of the Supreme Court. We will shortly come to its conclusion but few parallel developments are extremely interesting and gripping.  It was under the regime of Rajiv Gandhi that television serials such as Ramayan (1987) and Mahabharat (1988) were started on Doordarshan. These were followed by many TV serials depicting Hindu Gods and Goddesses (Jai Hanuman, Shri Krishna, Om Namah Shivay etc). This worked against Rajiv Gandhi and not only created public sentiment towards Hindutva but also led to increase in buying of Hindu scriptures and publishing houses such as Gita Press, Gorakhpur came in front.  No one knew at that time that the national politics was awaiting a massive upturn. In 1987, elections were conducted for Maharashtra legislative assembly. Dr. R.Y. Prabhoo contested & won from Vile Parle Constituency on a Shiv Sena ticket which had sought votes in the name of Hindutva. It was challenged as a corrupt practice and the Bombay High Court declared his election invalid. Bal Thackrey was also found guilty. Appeals were filed before the Supreme Court in 1989. In 1990, V P Singh became the Prime Minister with the support of BJP. The then BJP president Lal Krishna Advani took out a cross-country rath yatra with support from Shiv Sena and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) to garner support for the move to build a Ram temple at the site. This was a very important socio political development for the concept of Hindutva.  In the elections held in Feb 1990, BJP emerged as majority party in the Legislative Assemblies of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh & Rajasthan & formed the Govt.  In the 1990 election from Dadar constituency in Greater Bombay, Manohar Joshi, the BJP-Shiv Sena candidate won against his Congress rival, Nitin Bhaurao Patil. Patil alleged that speeches made by Joshi, Bal Thackeray, Pramod Nawalkar and Chhagan Bhujbal violated Section 123 (3) and (3A) of the Representation of People Act—that is of using religion in seeking votes. The main contention of the petitioner was that Shiv Sena and BJP sought votes “in the name of Hindutva, i.e. Hindu religion.” High Court declared the election void and this matter also reached the Supreme Court eventually. In the same elections, Abhiram Singh, another BJP Candidate won his seat from Santa Cruz constituency against C.D. Commachen. His election was also challenged and the matter also reached doors of Supreme Court eventually. In Thane Constituency, BJP’s candidate Kapse won against Congress (I)’s candidate Harbansh Singh. Singh challenged the election on ground of corrupt practices. This was on basis of speeches made by Pramod Mahajan, Sadhvi Reetambhara and LK Advani seeking votes in the name of Hindutva. HC nullified the election. This matter also reached the doors of SC eventually. Congress came to power at centre after elections in 1991, while BJP became the major opposition party. On 06.02.1992, the disputed structure Babri Masjid at Ayodhya was demolished. Within 10 days, the then President Shankar Dayal Sharma, who also had served as Central Minister for INC dismissed the State Governments in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh & Rajasthan. It was under the regime of Rajiv Gandhi that television serials such as Ramayan (1987) and Mahabharat (1988) were started on Doordarshan. These were followed by many TV serials depicting Hindu Gods and Goddesses (Jai Hanuman, Shri Krishna, Om Namah Shivay etc). This worked against Rajiv Gandhi and not only created public sentiment towards Hindutva but also led to increase in buying of Hindu In 1994, the important judgment in the SR Bommai’scase (1994 3 SCC 1) was pronounced. While confirming that secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution, seeking votes in the name of Hindutva also found recognition by SC, (Para 159 in the opinion of Ramaswamy J) by way of the submission of Ram Jethmalani on the issue. No express finding in this issue was however given by the Court. In the same year, Bharucha, J. in Ismail Faruqui[1994 (6) SCC 360] for himself & Ahmadi, J. observed - ""....Hinduism is a tolerant faith. It is that tolerance that has enabled Islam, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism to find shelter and support upon this land.” In a 3 judge combination speaking through Justice J.S. Verma, the Supreme Court decided appeals by Prabhoo and Bal Thackrey [1996 3 SCC 130, Para 31 onwards] and held that the word ""Hindutva"" by itself does not invariably mean Hindu religion and it is the context and the manner of its use which is material for deciding the meaning of the word ""Hindutva"" in a particular text. It cannot be held that in the abstract the mere word ""Hindutva"" by itself invariably must mean Hindu religion. It was further held that the words `Hinduism' or `Hindutva' are not necessarily to be understood & construed narrowly, confined only to the strict Hindu religious practices unrelated to the culture and ethos of the people of India, depicting the way of life of the Indian people unless the context of a speech indicates a contrary meaning or use, in the abstract these terms are indicative more of a way of life of the Indian people and are not confined merely to describe persons practising the Hindu religion as a faith. Considering the terms ‘Hinduism' or ‘Hindutva' per se as depicting hostility, enmity or intolerance towards other religious faiths or professing communalism, proceeds from an improper appreciation and perception of the true meaning of these expressions. Misuse of these expressions to promote communalism cannot alter the true meaning of these terms. The mischief resulting from the misuse of the terms by anyone in his speech has to be checked and not its permissible use. In Manohar Joshi’s Case [1996 1 SCC 169 decided on 11.12.1995], Justice JS Verma reiterated the same holding that it cannot be held that in the abstract the mere word ""Hindutva"" by itself invariably must mean Hindu religion. Similar challenges from Aurangabad Constituency [1996 1 SCC 394 decided on 11.12.1995], Nehru Nagar Constituency [1996 1 SCC 384 decided on 11.12.1995] and Kurla Constituency [1996 1 SCC 399 decided on 11.12.1995] were dumped using these judgments. In Kapse’s Case [1996 1 SCC 206 decided on 11.12.1995], Justice JS Verma held that there was no legal evidence to prove corrupt practice that votes were sought in the name of Hindu religion.  These set of judgments, popularly known as the Hindutva judgments hold the filed on the subject. However, few months later in Abhiram Singh’s case [1996 3 SCC 665 decided on 16.04.1996] the issue was referred to a larger bench by a 3 judge bench which did not include Justice JS Verma.  In 2002, in Narayan Singh v Sunderlal Patwal, a question of interpretation of Section 123(3) of the Representation of People’s Act, 1951 was referred to a bench of 7 judges. The issue in Abhiram Singh referred to a bench of 5 judges was heard by a bench led by Justice Lodha in 2013/14 which found that the issue involved interpretation of Section 123(3) of the Representation of People’s Act, 1951 and was tagged with Narayan Singh’s case. The 7 judge bench rendered a decision in question of reference in January 2017 and remanded the matter to regular bench of 5 judges. In February 2020, the same was mentioned to the Chief Justice SA Bobde who agreed to list the matter (which interestingly is a civil appeal from 1992) after the conclusion of the 9 judge bench hearing in Sabarimala hearing.  The matter still awaits final adjudication while the Hindutva judgments hold the field. The tryst of Hindutva with politics and judiciary still continues!

The Great Illusion of Communists, 26-Sep-2020, ,"Considered as one of the most idealistic principles to espouse by mankind, Communism today has become the evilest tyranny of the world, while the American Deep State and Chinese Communists have perfected the art of treachery through deceit, perfidy, hegemony to achieve world domination in collusion with the Illuminat Karl Marx, the father of Communism, known for espousing a classless, anti-bourgeois society, ironically had lived a lavish life alleged by his father spending more than the richest in town, owing to his affluent family history of wealthy merchants and links to the famous banker family Rothschild. The connection of Karl Marx with the Rothschild dynasty through their common Barent- Cohen ancestor of Amsterdam is well known. The ancestral Pressburg connection of Marx and German poet Heinrich Heine is of additional historical interest as these two distant cousins were on friendly terms for some time. It is fascinating to note while Das Capital was being written in London, Lionel Nathan Rothschild, son of the founder of Rothschild Bank England, was the First Jewish MP from London. Karl Marx, although had professed that the superstructure (democratic rule) would always be in cahoots with the substructure (capitalist economy). Ed Clark wrote in the Red Menace, “It is positively criminal when we, knowing full well the intentions of the Leninists, do nothing except make wise-cracks while they gradually learn enough to take over from the old capitalist class and re-establish class society on a new and much more terrible foundation!”  From the Book Michel Bakunin, Selected Writings edited and introduced by Arthur Lehning from the chapter ‘On Marx and Marxism’ he remarked about Marx’s ideology: “Do you know what this means? Nothing more or less than a new aristocracy, that of the urban and industrial workers, to the exclusion of the millions who make up the rural proletariat and who, in the previsions of the German social democrats, will in effect become subjects of this great so-called popular state. Class, power and state, these three terms are inseparable, each of them necessarily implying the other two, and summed up in aggregate by these words: the political subjugation and economic exploitation of the masses.” Communism is like a cult that doesn’t tolerate a dissent against itself. It legitimises throttling of voices from opposing camps. Since Lenin to Stalin to Mao to Castro, Communists have killed and massacred 100 million people around the world in the last 100 years and can be said to be the most violent faith in current times Within a decade the profits grew to Rs 3 million. The Soviet news agency Novosti provided further subsidies by routinely paying the CPI publishing house at a rate of 50% above its normal charges. The Soviets funded many election campaigns during the 1967 elections. At one point of time, there were almost 1,980 articles pushed and published by the KGB in India. Amounts totalling to nearly 15 million rupees were provided to various party officials, state party units. One such quantity undisclosed was received by a senior member of the party’s National Council codenamed BANKIR, and the receipts were given by General Secretary Rajeswar Rao (1964-90). Most of the funds received went to the trade unions headed by SA Dange and we know many industrial heavyweights in Bengal like Birla, Metal Box, Guest Keen Williams, Indian Standard Wagon, Braith Waite, Jessop and Company, Sulekha, Duckback, Aluminium Corporation, Usha Fan, Joy Engineering Works were forced to shut down because of labour strikes, labour disputes and lockout all across the state most of the times deliberately. Jyoti Basu the then Chief Minister of Bengal was heard saying once, a Capitalist is a class enemy, don’t expect sympathy from the government when the industrialist went to seek help for bankruptcy, facing strikes and power cuts. In 1965, there were 179 Strikes and 49 lockouts and in 1970, 678 strikes happened and the communist trade unions executed 128 lockouts. In 1977 AICTU received 10,000 Swiss Francs and US$ 43,750. Sanjay Gandhi once famously said about the CPI “I don’t think you would find a richer or more corrupt people anywhere”. The lecherous communists even supported China in 1962 war on India and professed their love for the then chairman Mao.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/26/The-Great-Illusion-of-Communists.html

Misquoting the Sangh leadership out of context is going to yield any result. Instead of repeating the same rant and exposing himself, Imran Khan should focus on the internal situation in Pakistan Since August 2019 Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan has started a relentless campaign against Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Whether it’s in United Nations (UN) conference or any other multinational forum, Imran Khan doesn’t miss a chance to malign RSS. His only allegation against RSS is that “RSS is a Nazi organisation”, that “the founding fathers of RSS were inspired by Nazi Germany” and “Hindutva is a racist/Nazi ideology”.

The NGO Landscape in Bharat has to change; Meaningful partnership with the Govt and transparency is the key, 13-Oct-2020,-Vikram K Malkani,"Popular perception is thatnon-governmental or voluntary organisations (NGOs/VOs) are organisationshaving social or humanitarian agendas,and are funded in their noble missions by philanthropists and other individual and institutional donors. NGO uniting platforms such as WANGO and INSO reinforce these perceptions with lofty declarationsof serving humanity and promoting world peace. In an ideal world, every NGOshould providesome form of social or humanitarian support to individuals and sections of society where governments may not be able to reach.India’s population size combined with finite resources with governments gives individuals and NGOs unlimited opportunitiesto promote such initiatives. So, how many NGOs does India really have? In 2013, triggered by a Public Interest Litigationseeking transparency in finances of an NGO run by social activist Anna Hazare, the Supreme Courtasked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to identify all registered NGOs and statuses of filing of their balance sheets. CBI declared the number of NGOs in Indiato bea staggering 31 lakhs. Of theseonly 99125 were self-declared in NGO Darpan, a NITI Aayog platform that “provides space for interface between VOs/NGOs and key Government Ministries / Departments / Government Bodies”. It is worth noting that NGOs and VOs can be registered in India under a variety of acts, such as Indian Societies Registration Act (1861), Religious Endowments Act (1863), Trusts Act and Section 8 of the Companies Act.The 31 lakh NGOs identified by CBI were only the ones registered under Indian Societies Registration Act. So, the number includes all societies, including organisationsnot performing conventional NGO activities, and does not include NGOs registered under the other applicable acts. In addition, the exercise is five years old. So one cannot at all be certain of even the approximate number of NGOs in India having social agendas. A listing of NGOs/VOs operating in India could not be found in Union government sites. So there are several unanswered questions – how many real NGOs/VOs does India have? How many of them are Indian, how many non-Indian? And very importantly – What is the agenda of each? Who are their promoters and their donors? In the world’s largest democracy with literally countless NGOs operating across the country, it is critical that Union and state governments are aware of the number of real NGOs operating, their declared agendas, having oversight on their activities, sources of funding, financial spend,as well as their key appointments. Undoubtedly, this will be a colossal exercise requiring greater clarity to be introduced in the law itself, then filtering social, religious and political NGOs from all registered non-profit organisations, and finally,ensuring governance of them. Because of the longstandinglack of legal clarity on definition of NGOs, another interesting aspect about them isn’t know yet – how many have registered in India over the last 25-30 years, and whether thenumberscan be related to the national governments in power at the time of their registration. In addition to seeking answers on NGOs, it’s worth exploring one more dimension– the amount of funding they have been receiving, and its sources.Given the ambiguity around definition of NGOs, the amounts or percentage contributions by Indian and foreign donors will not be easy to figure out. However, some information on foreign funds sent to NGOs in India is publicly available.  Based onForeign ‘Donations’, With Hidden Agenda, Are Serious Danger To India's National Security (Outlook,28-Jan-20), and inputs from  GoI, below are graphical representations of amount of foreign fundingthat has flowed into India to NGOs from 1998-99 till 2018-19 – a period that spanned Union governments under National Democratic Alliance and United Progressive Alliance. From ₹3295 crores in 1998-99, NGOs/VOs received ₹20011 crores in 2018-19. In percentage terms, with 1998-99 as base year, there was an increase of over 400% in the last two years of this period. Apart from three years during this period, the inflow has always been higher than in the preceding years. The biggest jump in foreign funding during this period happened in 2005-06, the first year of the Indian National Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) being in power. There was another steep one in 2015-16, a year after the Narendra Modi led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) came to power. According to the same article, on 01-Apr-17 the total foreign origin funds brought forward by the NGOs were ₹15,907 crores. Meanwhile, an amount greater than that brough forward – ₹19,764 crores– was further pumped into India in the year 2017-18. Since when did money become this cheap? According to CBI in 2015, only 10% NGOs were filing their balance sheets. NDA cracked the whipby cancelled FCRA licenses of approximately 14,500, and the registration altogether of over 1800 NGOs for non-submission of returns in 2017-18 To sum up the situation, India has an unusuallylarge number of NGOs with their categorizations not being clear, a very small percentage of NGOs are attracting huge amounts of sustained foreign funding, those NGOs are hoarding large amountsof money but still attracting funds year after year, over 90% of the ones investigated weren’t filing balance sheets, and only a tiny fraction have registered in NGO Darpan. Clearly, such a situation that would make any government suspicious. What exactly are the wealthy NGOs doing? For sure, many NGOs in India are fulfilling the purpose for which they are created – feeding the hungry, providing education to children, supporting enterprising women to become financially independent, rehabilitating those affected by natural calamities, and so on. But what are some others up to? Here are some insights. In 2012 in a rare display of assertiveness (only just, but welcome nevertheless), the then Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh had accused NGOs funded by United States and Scandinavian countries of disrupting India’s development objectives, specifically, pursuingnuclear power and genetically modified crops.Based onan Intelligence Bureau (IB) report, the UPA govt had gone a step further andaccusedcertain NGOs of indulging in antinational and political activities.The stand taken by UPA came none too soon. According to UPA’s Environment Minister, Jayanthi Natarajan, certain NGOs had penetrated the highest levels of decision making in her ministry. INC has a history of warmth towardsNGOs. Ford Foundation was illegally accommodated in India soon after Independence by no less than India’s first Prime Minister (Ford Foundation an entity outside law. The Sunday Guardian, 06-Jun-15).And two political generations on, an extra-constitutional body National Advisory Committee, which “advised” the UPA govt, was established. Headed by UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi, it had people linked with NGOs as its members. UPA seems to have done little more than order the investigation and subsequently protest publicly during the last two years of its rule.In spite of Jayanthi Natarajan’s statement, there were no media reports of a cleanup of her ministry (or any other, if those too had been compromised). Another area UPA seemed to be unwilling to challenge was religious conversions by some foreign money funded NGOs. To be clear, only a handful of Indian states have laws against conversions. So technically, organisations can promote conversions in other states. However, according to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act 2010, there are restrictions on acceptance of foreign funds for religious conversions. What has the NDA govt done? The IB report was submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon after he assumed office in 2014. Credit must go to the NDA for taking decisive action against wayward NGOs. According to CBI in 2015, only 10% NGOs were filing their balance sheets. NDA cracked the whipby cancelled FCRA licenses of approximately 14,500, and the registration altogether of over 1800 NGOs for non-submission of returns in 2017-18. Multiple India-based entities under Amnesty International have landed into trouble with GoI over several FCRA violations. Amnesty International was accused of violating FCRA in Nov-19 and its offices were raided by CBI. Last week AA closed down its operations in India, while claiming that GoI was on a witch hunt. The crackdown in general has led to aggressive attemptsto show the violative NGOs as victims and the usual performances by the usual actors on social media.If indeed GoI agencies have fabricated violations in spite of accounts showing compliance to FCRA, what stops AA or any other NGO from approaching the Supreme Court? Why are they not grabbing this golden opportunity to prove their longstanding charges of fascism against the Narendra Modi-led govt? On NGOs promoting religious conversions NDA has taken the bull by its horns. In 2016 it barred an institutional American donor from funding religious conversions via a Tamil Nadu-based NGO. In Sep-20 it suspended the foreign funding licenses of 13 NGOs, allegedly over conversions, in violation of FCRA 2010. This stand hashad the expected backlash.Two US government-sponsored reports have taken strong exception to the FCRA and anti-conversion laws being misused to “undermine” religious freedom. Consider a hypothetical situation of some Hindu organisations setting up branches in democracies having non-Hindu majorities, receiving considerable sustained funding from Hindu temple trusts, even from GoI, and converting non-Hindus while possibly disguising their agenda with social initiative. Will such an arrangement have governmental support in those democracies? In addition to actions against illegalities of various NGOs including high profile ones, the Union govt has also introduced reforms. The FCRA Amendment Bill 2020 mandates declaration of Aadhaar for each office bearer of an NGO, prohibits public servants from receiving any foreign funding, prohibits transfer of received foreign funds to another association/person. So far NGOs have had allowance to budget up to 50% of their funds as administrative expenses. According to the 2020 amendment, this has been capped at 20%, aligning NGOs more closely with their noble missions than being about lucrative careers. It also aligns with sentiments of genuine donors, who would rather pay for meals or education of underprivileged children’s than for business class travel of executives of NGOs. Earlier amendments to FCRA by NDA have included all members of NGOs seeking foreign contribution to declare that they have not been “prosecuted or convicted” for “conversion” from one faith to another and for creating “communal tension and disharmony” and made it mandatory for all non-governmental organisations that receive or hope to receive foreign funding to register with NGO Darpan. Although passed by Parliament, the 2020 amendment bill too was met with trademark opposition by INC and others on various provisions. What more should GoI do? The NDA govt has undoubtedly taken a series of bold steps to get a clearer picture on NGOs versus non-NGOs in India, increase transparency in NGOs’ funding and activities, channel greater amount of donors’ money towards social and humanitarian causes, and improve governance over compliance to FCRA and other applicable laws. Clearly, these were long overdue. Governments in India may never have sufficient resources to provide for fundamental needs of all individuals andsociety. This makes the role of genuine NGOs critical in extending govt initiatives, and evolving their own. A fruitful NGO-government partnership in India is a distant goal, but several significant steps have been taken towards it.

As the fact-finding team of the Call For Justice, on the Delhi riots, revealed, that there was a wider plan to create social disharmony and turmoil in the country.

"Rashtra Sevika Samiti: An organisation of women, by women, for the Nation", 26-Oct-2020,,"The Samiti, the largest women’s organisation in the country, stands out among feminist outfits in terms of its philosophy. Rooted in the ethos of the country, it believes in the ideals of matrutva (motherhood), kartrutva (duty consciousness) and netrutva (leadership) -Aparna Singh The journey of the plight of women in India and indeed, across the world was in huge contrast. While ancient India, guided by the philosophy of the Vedas, always regarded women as the source of power and prosperity, the same was not accorded to the women in other parts of the world which was mostly under the influence of Semitic philosophy which regarded women as inferior beings. Under the influence of such Semitic philosophy and the medieval degradation of our society, the plight of women in India also became deplorable. Many socio-cultural movements took up the task of reinstating the old glory to women. Surprisingly, most of such movements were initiated by men. West never had any past to look up to for the respectable place of women in society. They saw exploitation by men as the reason for their pitiable condition and it was this that gave rise to the male-female dichotomy which dominates the feminist discourse around the world including India. Rashtra Sevika Samiti, the world’s largest voluntary organisation for women, has remained outside the national discourse on women either out of choice or has been purposely denied its legitimate place. They labellled it as traditional, orthodox and communal which does not stand for gender concerns Rashtra Sevika Samiti, the world’s largest voluntary organisation for women, has remained outside the national discourse on women either out of choice or has been purposely denied its legitimate place. They labelled it as traditional, orthodox and communal which does not stand for gender concerns and reinstates patriarchy. If we dive down the structure, function and the life of the sevikas, one will not find a match for its contemporaneity. As early as the 1930s and 40s a sevika named Bakultai Devkule, a shooter, motorist, swimmer, first sevika and the all India General Secretary (karyavahika) of Rashtra Sevika Samiti, married a non-RSS affiliate, against the wishes of her father. There are numerous examples which defy that Samiti is orthodox and patriarchal. The founder, Vandaneeya Lakshmi Bai Kelkar (Mausiji) herself becoming a widow at a very early stage undertook the task of forming such a vast organisation on October 25, 1936. She along with another lady named Vandaneeya Saraswati Tai Apte took the organisation across the country. Modernity can be gauged from the fact that sevikas, consisting of married and unmarried women, bow before them every morning in the shakhas. Their contribution to nation-building made them sacred transcending their identities as widows, the mere sight of whom is abhorred by the orthodox elements of the society. Rashtra Sevika Samiti took up the cause of women not considering them as victims but to unlock the potential of the 50% of the population necessary for nation-building. Labelling it as orthodox is to delegitimise its genuine efforts to make women take a lead role in its endeavour to bring glory to the motherland Since its inception Samiti has always stood for a strong and determined role of women in nation-building. The feminist movements could not find resonance with this organisation because it was anathema to their basic understanding of the relationship between men and women as binaries. Samiti advocated that they are complementary to each other unlike any other feminist organisation around the world or even within the country, who always saw conflict between them. Samiti is often accused of not upholding the rights of women. It was therefore denied a place in the national discourse. Not playing victims and taking up a more responsible role in nation-building was seen as a dent on the feminist agenda. The three ideals of Samiti for matrutva (motherhood), kartrutva (duty consciousness) and netrutva (leadership) in Jija mata, Ahilyabai and Rani Lakshmi bai respectively are themselves stark examples of denying the gender roles ascribed to women of the contemporary society. Beauvoir, a protagonist of feminism in the western world, was a lady who stood for individual rights and liberty to the extent that she openly displayed her bisexuality and even resorted to child abuse as an expression of female liberty. Taking the inspiration from such proponents for women rights will instil similar ethos in the movement which we are witnessing is the blatant display of woman as a commodity. Succumbing to the western idea of feminism and women rights which was in perpetual competition with men, Indian feminist movement also fell prey to such ideas.   Rashtra Sevika Samiti took up the cause of women not considering them as victims but to unlock the potential of the 50% of the population necessary for nation-building. Labelling it as orthodox is to delegitimise its genuine efforts to make women take a lead role in its endeavour to bring glory to the motherland. It reiterates that economic strength cannot be the sole factor deciding the capability of a person to make a constructive impact on the existing social structure. Economic independence for women to secure their safety post-marriage tussle, as advocated by the feminist is a lesser objective of Samiti. Imagine if every man claimed to be economically dependent only to support himself, what would happen to the existing social system where most women are dependent on men for their economic needs? For Samiti earning a livelihood is not to just become self-dependent but to become dependable for their children, family and particularly for the nation.   When Samiti refers to women as matrushakti it not only refers to a biological mother but the one who sows the seeds of empathy, character, sensitivity, morality and affection among the upcoming as well as contemporary generations. Such tasks are also shouldered by pracharikas (full-time workers) who have chosen to never become biological mothers but are referred to as matrishakti because they instil the moral character and love for the nation in their sevikas. Samiti has held that women are more capable in many skills not only because mythology or the dharma says so, but it has also been proved in many pieces of research in the modern world. A 2018 research report of Robby Berman in the World Economic Forum found that at any hour of the day women are capable of doing more work than men. Another study published in BMC Psychology found that women are better at multitasking than men. Just like the reproduction, capability of women is not their achievement but their anatomy, similarly capability to do more work is because of the genetic makeup of the brain. Samiti acknowledges these differences not to look down upon the other gender but as a greater responsibility to contribute towards the family, society and the nation.   Mausiji, addressing the annual meeting of all India Rashtra Sevika Samiti held in Mumbai in 1953, said that ‘woman is the charioteer of life and man is the hearse (jeevan roopi rath ki saarthi stri hai aur purush rathi hai). She wondered if man represents motion then who has put him into motion? It is the woman who puts the man into motion. Unlike the claims of the feminists that Samiti is a traditional organisation which seeks to uphold Brahmanical rituals, it has always kept its mission of nation-building above everything else. During the annual meeting of all India Rashtra Sevika Samiti held in Wardha in 1961 from November 13 to 15, the sister in law (wife of Mausiji’s husband’s elder brother) of Mausiji, who was also her very close associate passed away. She performed the final rites and joined the meeting on 14th evening and on the 15th, she was there till the finale. She said that ‘Person’s loyalty is not important but loyalty to element is important (vyakti nishtha nahi tatva nishtha hi mahatvpurn hai). Setting an example before her sevikas that no ritual, no tradition is as important as the task of reinstating Bharat Mata to her past glory. Feminist outfits could not find resonance with Samiti because it was anathema to their understanding of the relationship between men and women as binaries. Samiti advocated that they are complementary to each other unlike any other feminist organisation, who always saw conflict between them Samiti works pan India and in more than 18 other countries. With more than 2700 shakhas and 475 plus sewa projects Samiti proactively addresses the challenges before the society. During the pandemic, it distributed 4,26,237 gloves, masks and PPE kits, 1,09,696 ration kits and served 4,23,794 food packets. Samiti is aware of the vices existing in the society and vehemently opposes subjugation and oppression of women and also prepares its sevikas to confront and oppose such situations. But it sees the permanent solution not simply in legal protections and perpetual competition with men but in preparing a generation with virtues. Samiti takes up this task on themselves as the first teacher of their child. It is the only organization by the women, of the women and for the nation, which talks about its duties first and their rights later.

#BuddhaPurnima The Gospel of Buddha: Avoiding the Ten Evils, 07-May-2020,,"The Buddha said: ""All acts of living creatures become bad by ten things, and by avoiding the ten things they become good. There are three evils of the body, four evils of the tongue, and three evils of the mind."" ""The evils of the body are, murder, theft, and adultery; of the tongue, lying, slander, abuse, and idle talk; of the mind, covetousness,- hatred, and error."" ""I exhort you to avoid the ten evils: I. “Kill not, but have regard for life.” II. “Steal not, neither do ye rob; but help everybody  to be master of die fruits of his labour.” III. “Abstain from impurity, and lead a life of chastity.” IV. “Lie not, but be truthful. Speak the truth with discretion, fearlessly and in a loving heart.” V. “Invent not evil reports, neither do ye repeat them.

#BuddhaPurnima : The Indic Buddha, 07-May-2020,Papia Mitra,"Buddha Purnima is a time of celebration and introspection not by just Buddhists, but also by all followers of Indic way of living. Buddhadeva, as any Wikipedia will tell you, is the founder of a new creed called Buddhism, which is spread all over the world. Yet, simultaneously, he is also an avatar of Vishnu among Hindus and honoured with appropriate devotion. Nor do the Buddhists object to this. Thus he is something more than the founder of just one single religion. Yet this dual status surprises no one except those who are monotheists unable to look beyond a simple binary of God and the Devil. The Sakyamuni’s teachings were a break from then prevalent tradition, and a new way of living, but not so radical that all continuity with the past is lost and no links remained with traditional culture. Buddha himself understood this and that is why he did not create a new term for his new creed.  That is why he called it ‘dhamma‘, that is, dharma, as the common people of his day pronounced it.  Buddhism then is Dharma as we understand it. Academicians of religion argue that it is something different from Hinduism. As proof, they point out conflicts among Buddhists and Hindus in history and differences in doctrines. But looking at it through the western lens they mistake the matter. The conflicts or arguments were more on basis of philosophical points among the scholars, and -- human nature being what it is -- sometimes over royal patronages and gifts to stupas and mandirs. Even among the elite, we find noblemen and royal families patronising both. No historical evidence tells us of ordinary people rioting among themselves, or either faith systems being forcibly imposed on the people. On the contrary, the followers of the new learning and the old among the masses lived as a culturally integrated people, distinguished certainly in some practices and ways of worship, but no more than the Saivaite is different from the Sakta. The reason is that dharma is the overarching principle that upholds the universe and guides human beings as social creatures. That is why Hindus call it Sanatan Dharma, the binding and guiding structure that has always existed.  Buddha was born into Sanatan Dharma milieu. He was educated in the philosophies of Vedas and Upanishads and taught the laws laid down in Sastras. He absorbed the values of the society he grew up in. ( I am not using the word ‘Hindu’ because that at that time the word  would be more a geographical marker than a name for a particular community). It is not surprising therefore that when he revolted against established norms, he would not set his face against dharma; instead what he propagated was a much-needed reformation and showed the people yet another way of interpreting the world and how to live in it. He left his family and a world of power and wealth behind to seek enlightenment, exactly as the rishis had done in the past and will do again.  It is also significant that he was not put to death; nor did he have to establish his dhamma by warfare. Instead, he was accepted as a great teacher and finally found his place among the  The larger point of peaceful co-existence, becomes stronger when we look at the countries where Buddhism is the majority religion or substantial population follow Buddhism. Yet there is no conflict with religions native to them, even if those countries are far distant.  For example, China’s indigenous philosophy of Taoism and the Chinese folk gods, Japanese Shinto religion with its rich mythology, as old as Japanese culture itself has blended harmoniously with Buddhism, So too in Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Mongolia, Vietnam, Java, Indonesia, Malaysia. This is because the native ways of living and worshipping – before the coming of Semitic religions -- were inclusivist and more in tune with Sanatan Dharma. Interesting also to note that where Buddha went, so too went Rama! All over Asia, Ramayana is retold and performed in varying forms, the story of Rama providing a unifying connection of cultures. In fact, the national epic of Thailand is Ramakien and the king’s official title is Rama because Rama is the ideal king.  Thus even in lands far away from India, another version of Sanatan Dharma flourishes intertwined with Rama the avatar and hero.  We complete the circle and return to the original point. Buddha is not someone divorced from Sanatan Sanskriti, nor Buddhism an isolated phenomenon that suddenly sprang up in India and travelled out like commodity export. Au contraire, Buddhism and so-called Hinduism are simply two aspects of the same way of living and practising self-realisation. ",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/7/The-Indic-Buddha.html

Foundations of Indian Culture  by Sri Aurobindo The book is a defence of Indian civilisation and culture, with essays on Indian spirituality, religion, art, literature, and polity.

India's First War of Independence by Veer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar The Indian War of Independence is an Indian nationalist history of the 1857 revolt by Veer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar that was first published in 1909. The book, initially written in Marathi, was penned by Savarkar in response to celebrations in Britain of the 50th anniversary of the 1857 Indian uprising with records from India Office archives and the whole project received support from Indian nationalists in Britain including the likes of Madame Cama, V.V.S. Iyer and M.P.T. Acharya, as well as Indian students who had dared not show their support or sympathy for India House openly. Published during Savarkar's stay in London at the India House, the book was influenced by histories of the French Revolution and the American Revolution, as much as it sought to bring the Indian movement to public attention in Britain as well as to inspire nationalist revolution in India. Karl Marx had published an article named The Indian Revolt in the New-York Tribune,1857 and later went on to write the book The First Indian War of Independence 1857-58 in the coming years. Savarkar had published the book only later in 1909. (Read more about the book:  Buy here:  5. The Mahabharata translated by Bibek Debroy The Mahabharata is one of the greatest stories ever told. Though the basic plot is widely known, there is much more to the epic than the dispute between the Kouravas and Pandavas that led to the battle in Kurukshetra. It has innumerable sub-plots that accommodate fascinating meanderings and digressions, and it has rarely been translated in full, given its formidable length of 80,000 shlokas or couplets. This magnificent 10- volume unabridged translation of the epic is based on the Critical Edition compiled at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. Volume 1 consists of most of Adi Parva, in which much happens before the Kouravas and the Pandavas actually arrive on the scene. This volume covers the origins of the Kuru clan; the stories of Poushya, Poulama and Astika; the births of the Kouravas and the Pandavas; the house of lac; the slaying of Hidimba and Baka; Droupadi’s marriage; and ends with the Pandavas obtaining their share of the kingdom. Every conceivable human emotion figures in the Mahabharata, the reason why the epic continues to hold sway over our imagination. In this lucid, nuanced and confident translation, Bibek Debroy makes the Mahabharata marvellouly accessible to contemporary readers. Read more about the book and Buy here:  6.

It explores the possible causes for the decline of the Harappan civilization and settlements.

The author also discusses the Aryan invasion theory, supporting it with various research papers and findings of that time. The evolution of Hindu religion is also talked about in this book--from the Harappan times, to the coming of the Aryans and the mutual influence that Hinduism and its off shoots Jainism and Buddhism had on each other.

Anandamath by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay Originally written in 1882, by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee Anandamath takes the reader back to Bengal in the clutches of the famine, the backdrop of the pre-independence struggle and the turmoil of human lives caught in this frame of time. The plot of the novel reveals the various dimensions of life in the backdrop of the Sannyasi Rebellion—such as the plight of the people wrecked by lack of food and hunger that drove them to the brink of cannibalism, the militant rebels, and women’s participation alongside their husbands. It is considered one of the most remarkable works of Bangla language and Indian literature. The rebellion was fought by the sannyasi’s or monks and the common multitudes who took up arms against the tyranny of the British colonisers and their excesses, especially taxes in such a time of privation. Bankim also gave us the song ‘Vande Mataram’ which became the rallying call for rebels. The first two stanzas eventually became the National song of India. One of the gems of Indian Literature, ‘Anandmath’ carries a deep sentiment of nationalism which was the essence of the freedom struggle. (Read more about the book:  Buy here:  8.

Dr Ambedkar believed that it is impossible for a non-Muslim to live in an Islamic republic. “Islam is a close corporation and the distinction that it makes between Muslims and non-Muslims is a very real, very positive and very alienating distinction. The brotherhood of Islam is not the universal brotherhood of man. It is the brotherhood of Muslims for Muslims only. There is fraternity but its benefit is confined to those within that corporation.

Vesak- Buddha Poornima, is considered the Triple Blessed Day as it celebrates Tathagata Gautam Buddha's Birth, Enlightenment and Maha Parnirvana. Full text of Prime Minister’s Speech on the occasion of Vesak-Buddha Purnima Namskar !!! A Very Happy Buddha Purnima, Many happy Vesak celebrations to all of you and followers of Lord Buddha spread all over the world ! It is my good fortune that on this sacred day, I meet you and seek blessings from all of you. I got many such opportunities on earlier occasions. I was a part of the celebrations with you in 2015 and 2018 in Delhi, and in 2017 in Colombo. However, the circumstances this time are quite different. So we are unable to meet face to face. Friends, Lord Buddha said-  मनो पुब्बं-गमा धम्मा, मनोसेट्ठा मनोमया, It means, Dhamma (or the religion exists in  the mind, Mind is supreme. It leads all actions. It is the mind that connects me with you. That is why, the lack of physical presence is not so felt. It would be a great pleasure to be among you, but now the circumstances are not favorable.     So, though remotely located, with the help of technology, we are getting an opportunity to interact with each other, and I should say that this is satisfying enough.  Friends, International Buddhist organization deserve praise for organizing a virtual Vesak Buddha Purnima Day in these difficult circumstances of lockdown. Due to your innovative efforts, millions of followers from all over the world are joining each other in this event.     Besides Lumbini, Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and Kushinagar, the integration of ceremonies taking place at Sri Anuradhapura Stupa and Vaskaduwa Temple in Sri Lanka, are really very beautiful. Online streaming of worship programs being held everywhere is in itself an amazing experience. You have pledged to celebrate this event as a prayer week for the frontline warriors from all over the world who are fighting the Corona global epidemic. I commend you for this compassionate initiative. I am fully confident that with such organized efforts, we will be able to get humanity out of this difficult challenge and reduce the troubles of the people.  Friends, the message and resolve to remove the difficulty of every life have always shown direction to India's civilization, culture. Lord Buddha has further enriched this culture of India. Lord Buddha in his life’s after enlightenment also enriched the lives of many others as well. His message is not limited to any one circumstance, or to any one subject.      For many centuries, before and after Siddhartha's birth, after the turning of  Siddhartha into Gautama, the cycle of time continues to rotate taking us through many  situations and circumstances. Time changed, the situation changed, the functioning of society changed, but the message of Lord Buddha has been continuously flowing in our lives. It was possible only because Buddha is not just a name, but also a sacred thought, a thought that beats in every human heart, guides humanity. Buddha is the limit to renunciation and penance.    Buddha is synonymous with service and dedication. Buddha, with a strong will power, is the climax of social change. Buddha is the one who is devoted to perseverance, self-sacrificing, and spreading joy all over the world. And look at the good fortune of all of us, at this time we are seeing many people around us, who serve others, treat a patient, feed a poor person, clean a hospital, to maintain law and order on a road, they all working round the clock. In India, outside India, every such person deserves a salute, a tribute. Friends, at a time when there is turmoil in the world, many times the feeling of sadness, despair and frustration is seen very much, then the learning of Lord Buddha becomes even more relevant. He used to say that human beings should constantly strive to overcome difficult situations, get out of them. Getting tired and tired is not an option. Today, all of us are also constantly working together to get out of a difficult situation.    Four truths told by Lord Buddha- Mercy, Compassion, Non-Chalance either in happiness and sorrow, and accepting someone with its all virtues and faults- These truths continue to be the inspiration of the land of India.  You are also seeing today that India is standing firmly in selflessness, without any distinction, with the person in distress, both in the country and throughout the world.    Beyond the profit and loss, able and unable, for us this hour of crisis is to help others, as much as possible to forward the hand of help.     This is the reason why many countries of the world have remembered India in this difficult time and India has left no stone upturned to reach every needy.      Today, India is making every effort to save the life of every Indian, and is following its global obligations equally seriously.    Friends, each and every word, each and every discourse of Lord Buddha reinforce India's commitment to serve humanity. The Buddha symbolizes both the Enlightenment of India and the Self-Realization of India. With this self-realization, India is and will continue to work for the benefit of the entire humanity, the whole world. India's progress will always be helpful in the progress of the world.     Friends, both our scales and goals of success will change over time. However, the thing we always have to keep in mind is that our work should be done with continuous service. When there is compassion for others, compassion and a sense of service, these feelings make us so strong that you can overcome the biggest challenge. सुप्प बुद्धं पबुज्झन्ति,  सदा गोतम सावका, that is, those who are engaged in the service of humanity at all times, day and night, are the true followers of Buddha. This spirit keeps illuminating our lives, keeps it moving.    With these wishes I would like to thank all of you. In this difficult situation, take care of yourself, your family, and the country whichever you live in, protect yourself and help others as much as possible.    May everyone's health be good, with this wish I end my speech.  Thank you!! Sarv Mangalam!!!

Narad Jayanti: Devrishi Narada’s Relevance in the Age of Digital Media, 09-May-2020,Prof K G Suresh,"When the ABVP Bihar unit requested me for a Facebook Live lecture earlier this week on Sage Narada’s Journalism: Need of the Nation, as a media person myself, I started pondering over the current state of media and how Devrishi Narada would have reacted to that. Narada, one of the ‘Saptarishis’ and ‘Prajapatis’, the Chief of the Gandharvas or divine musicians, is revered by many as the ‘Adi Patrakar’ or the first ever journalist in human history. In no other part of the world, in no other civilization, tradition, culture, classics, mythology or sacred texts, do you have such a character who was a communicator par excellence. Yet, the inventor of musical instrument Veena and the divine mediator was always projected, particularly in Indian cinema and TV serials more as a comic character who indulged in gossip and created differences between the Devas and Asuras. But what was lost sight of, of course deliberately and due to ignorance, were the principles of communication this universe trotter enunciated as he traversed the heavens, the earth and the netherworld, in the pursuit of truth. In a highly polarized media domain, Narad’s equanimity and cordiality with Devas, Asuras, Vanaras, Kinnars and Gandharvas, all of whom equally adored him, stands out as an example worthy of emulation for all communicators. He had no bias or prejudice, no personal axe to grind, no scores to settle. ‘Vishwa Kalyan’ (universal welfare) was the sole mission of his life. He was not a gossip monger but a conveyer of facts. There are several instances where he has praised demon kings much to the discomfort of the Gods including Lord Indra. When mankind, including sages, were harassed by the evil forces, he would dutifully draw the attention of the divine beings including the Holy Triumvirate (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) to remedy the situation forthwith and provide relief to the masses. Speed, accuracy and objectivity, the cardinal principles of journalism were articles of faith for him. Simple to the core, he traversed the three worlds tirelessly without any ostentation. He was the ultimate field reporter relying more on seeing events personally before reporting them as against the current trend of desktop journalism. A gossip monger would always act opportunistically to obtain information shifting his loyalties at the drop of a hat. But Narada never hid his loyalties to the Lord, relentlessly chanting his name, yet he won the confidence of even the enemies of the gods, who revealed to him their innermost secrets. He had the courage to tell the demons on their face about their wrong doings without earning their wrath. He never hesitated from forewarning the evil forces about their fate if they don’t mend their ways yet no powerful man or demon could influence him to compromise on his integrity. He pleaded for a fair trial and justice to even the most wicked and cruel yet never conducted a Kangaroo court (as we see now-a-days on prime time television) and punished the culprits. He never arrogated to himself the role of a judge. The Sage never pre-judged people but came to conclusions only after personal experience. There were no untouchables for him. He was accessible to everyone and had contacts cutting across the universal spectrum. It was for the Gods to punish. His task was only to inform and educate and where necessary, mediate; to juxtapose truth and falsehood, for the larger good of the universe (Lok Kalyan). Narada was also an erudite scholar not a shallow, superficial journalist who carried tales. In fact, among the 18 Puranas, Narada Purana is perhaps the most significant as it was created by none other than the divine sage himself. It is said, “Naradoktam Puraanam Tu Naardiyam Prachachhate” (Narad Purana is what emerged from the lips of Maharshi Narad). Initially it had a collection of about twenty-five thousand stanzas. But, the currently available version of Narad Purana contains not more than twenty-two thousand stanzas. As we struggle to evolve a code of conduct for the media, even 70 years after independence, one can take a cue from Lord Krishna who perhaps elaborated on the same while describing the qualities of Sage Narada. Responding to a question from King Ugrasena on why he was so fond of Narada, Krishna says, “I bow down to that Narada who has been born from the lap of Brahma, who has no arrogance due to learning or good conduct, but whose learning and good conduct are well known. I bow down to that Narada who has none of these defects—absence of interest, anger, fickleness and fear. He is composed and free from (habitual) procrastination. I pay obeisance to that Narada who does not change his word (once uttered) either due to lust or to covetousness and who is conversant with the principles and goal of spiritual endeavour, who is forbearing, powerful and straightforward, who has conquered his sense organs and who speaks the truth. “I bow down to that Narada who is full-grown and venerable in respect of splendour, fame, intellect, prudence, humility, birth, and penance, whose conduct and dress are pleasing and whose diet, behaviour, eyes and utterances are good, who is tirelessly engaged in altruism, who has no sin, who is enthusiastically engaged in bringing good to others, who always abides by the duties enjoined in the Vedas, Smritis and Puranas and who is free from either pleasure or displeasure, who is uninterested in food stuffs and other things, who is learned, who is never idle, who is a Brahmana of vast learning and whose narratives are charming, who has never erred before in respect of wealth, anger, and love, and by whom these defects have been eliminated, who is devoid of the defect of infatuation and fascination, who has unwavering devotion to God and Bhagawat Dharma, whose moral policies are supreme and who is of a reserved disposition, who is never contaminated by contacts, who is eloquent and who has no prolonged doubts, who never finds fault with any scriptural text, whose life is a personification of penance, who never spends his time without recollecting God and who always keeps his mind under control. “I salute that Narada who puts in great efforts, who exerts his intelligence, who is never satiated with concentration, and meditation and who never errs in his efforts, who does not become elated by the acquisition of wealth, who does not become dejected on account of non-acquisition, who is richly endowed with all good qualities, who is efficient, pure and unafraid, who knows the proper occasions and is conversant with good policies.” Narada indeed stands out as a beacon light to the media fraternity as it passes through a turbulent phase marked by sharp decline in values and ethics, commercialisation and commodification, sensationalism, pessimism, materialism, corruption, immaturity, irresponsibility, immorality, arrogance, ideological fanaticism, lack of scholastics, courage, conviction, mission and vision. The Lord himself was so impressed by the divine minstrel that In Chapter 10, Shloka 26 of the Bhagavad Gita, the song celestial, he tells Arjuna, “Of all trees, I am the holy fig tree, and amongst sages and demigods, I am Narada… (The author is a senior journalist and former Director-General, Indian Institute of Mass Communication)",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/9/Narad-Jayanti.html

US based tech couple with roots in Gujarat goes for digital wedding ceremony; Online guests chose to contribute in @PMCares as wedding gift, 15-Jun-2020,,"The couple Jay and Riya also urged all their well-wishers to contribute to the PM Cares Fund instead of gifting the money to them. With more than 13,00,000 positive cases and 75,000+ reported deaths due to Corona Virus, USA has become a hardest hit country due to Corona. Amid this scenario, a USA based Gujarati Youth has made an unprecedented decision about their wedding and chose to lead by an example. Bhavnagar (Gujarat) based, coordinator of Bharatiya Vichar Manch and veteran leader of RSS Mr. Ajaybhai Sheth (Ex-BSNL)'s son Jay and USA based Mr. Rajendra Shah's daughter Riya did a exemplary act in America and made India proud. In today's health emergency, when people try to find a reason to go out by violating rules of physical distancing and lock-down norms in many parts of the country, this couple from NJ has set an example for others. Jay and Riya's wedding was decided on April 17th. However, due to the COVID-19 situation, it became a challenge. The couple was determined to abide by social distancing rules and complete all the preparations without stepping out of home. Techies by profession, Jay & Riya made it happen by planning the wedding at the  granular level. Every traditional Indian wedding is incomplete without Var-Mala (Garland). The couple prepared their own unique garlands using rose petals and threads of rakhis, which symbolizes knots of love and commitment. Groom's parents residing at Bhavnagar and Bride's parents residing at Vadodara along with other relatives blessed the newly weds through an online video call. By respecting social distancing guidelines and considering safety, the couple didn't invite the Pandit Maharaj in person though he lives nearby to their residence in USA. Pandit Maharaj performed all the necessary rituals and chants of Vedic shlokas over an online video call. Wedding gift money to PM Cares Fund  Not limiting themselves to this unique achievement or sharing photos of their online wedding, the couple took yet another commendable action. They urged all their well-wishers, relatives and friends to contribute the amount meant as gift of their wedding to PM Cares Fund. They had indicated that any amount would be find by them. Their challenge got an unbelievable positive response and became a new trend on Instagram. Jay and Riya opined that if every Indian donates a rupee, it will add around 130 crores to the Nation's fund and will help the country tremendously in this difficult time. The exemplary act of Jay & Riya to consider nation first above their own interests has won accolades from the world over. ",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/15/US-based-tech-couple-with-roots-in-Gujarat-goes-for-digital-wedding-ceremony.html
Indian Americans and Friends of India hold Protest against China at Times Square in New York, 07-Jul-2020,,"Seek diplomatic isolation and economic boycott of the Chinese Communist party. Urges Prime Minister Modi, President Trump and Prime Minister Abe to lead a global coalition against China. Jagdish Sewhani and others at Boycott China Protest in New York New York, July 03, 2020:  A large number of Indian Americans joined a protest demonstration against China at the iconic Times Square on Friday. They were also joined by members of the Tibetan community and Taiwanese Americans. Addressing the peaceful gathering, Jagdish Sewhani, President of the American India Public Affairs Committee said that at a time when the entire world is battling the deadly coronavirus, the naked aggression shown by China, against its neighbourhood including India has exposed the true intentions of this rogue Communist regime. “I say it rogue, because the way it is treating its own people in Hong Kong, it has been busy doing ethnic cleansing against the peace-loving people of Tibet. And now it is doing the same against the Muslims / Uyghurs in Xinjiang province of China,” he said. “Not only that today its entire population is under constant surveillance. And now it wants to convert the entire world into a surveillance State. It’s recent behaviour and action only proves this,” he said. In his address, Sewhani called for the diplomatic isolation of China. He urged the international community to immediately start boycotting Chinese products. “We peace-loving people of the world want to let China know that enough is enough. They need to stop immediately all their aggressive behaviour against its neighbours including India,” Sewhani said. “So far, India has remained silent and shown to the world that it wants to have peace with the world. This approach of peace should not be considered as our weakness,” he said. “I want to use this occasion to let China know that in 2020 it is Modi’s India and not Nehru’s India when they took India for a ride. Today we are militarily and economically strong. We have a strong leader in Prime Minister Modi. India under him will give a befitting reply to the nefarious designs of President Xi Jinping of China,” Sewhani said.“And if the success of Modi’s policies is of any indication, China’s image in the world has never been as worse as it is today. From Australia to Japan to Germany, to the United Kingdom and here in the United States, President Trump – every world leader has come out in support of India,” he said.  Prem Bhandhari , Alok Kumar , Rajendra Bafna, Pritam Shah and Deependra Singh , Satvinder Singh also spoke at the event expressing support to Prime Minister Modi and urging to Boycott China Sewhani said that China should be ready to pay a heavy price of its aggression. “It’s time for we the democratic and peace-loving people of the world to give a befitting reply to China. Time has come for the whole world to unite against this bully China,” he said. Sewhani said: “If we need to defeat this monster, save the mankind and the democratic values and freedom we all love, we need to hit China on three fronts A) Trade: The entire world should boycott Chinese products. B) Tibet: We should support independence of Tibet C) Taiwan: Come out in support of Taiwan The three Ts can be successfully handled by a global coalition led by three world leaders: MTA 1. Modi: Prime Minister Narendra Bhai Modi of India 2. Trump: President Donald Trump of the United States 3. Abe: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan Dorjee Tseten, Member of Tibetan Parliament in Exile & Executive Director, Students for a Free Tibet said that We strongly condemn the Chinese military invasion on Indian soil. China’s greed stretches far beyond Tibet but also to the whole Himalayan region and the world at large as part of their aggressive expansionist policy. This most recent tragedy demonstrates China's occupation of Tibet is a threat to international peace and security. In addition to the Chinese government’s mishandling of the Coronavirus outbreak, Beijing has further threatened global security by waging a military invasion against India. The Chinese Communist totalitarian regime must be held accountable for flouting international law and wreaking havoc around the world. We call India and world governments to take immediate multilateral action against Beijing’s authoritarian rule by rejecting the ‘One China Policy’ in theory and practice.” Jagdish Sewhani President of The American India Public Affairs Committe and the organisers of the Boycott China at Time Square , New York",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/7/Indian-Americans-and-Friends-of-India-holds-Protest-against-China-at-Times-Square-in-NY.html
"‘The Neasden Temple has been at the forefront of many community service initiatives’: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Prince Charles hail 25 years of Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in London", 21-Aug-2020,,"On the occasion of Neasden Temple's silver jubilee, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the temple has been at the forefront of many community service initiatives and it has inspired people to work for humanity. The Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in London is the first Hindu temple in the western hemisphere that has now become a centre of community events, worship and festivals over the years. Taking to Twitter, PM Modi posted pictures of his visit to the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, London - popularly known as the Neasden Temple. ""Neasden Temple marks its silver jubilee. The Temple has been at the forefront of many community service initiatives. It has brought people together and inspired them to work for humanity,"" PM Modi tweeted. ""When I was Gujarat CM, I had the honour of visiting the Temple. #Neasdentemple25 #LM25,"" he added. Inaugurated on August 20, 1995, the temple in Neasden in the borough of Brent has been visited by several world leaders, including former US President Jimmy Carter. Prince Charles joined British MPs, charity organisations and others to mark the 25th anniversary of the temple. Prince Charles issued a video message, recalling visiting the temple with his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, during festivals. He said: “The first of its kind outside India, Neasden Temple serves the local community as a place of worship, learning, celebration, peace and community service”. According to the temple’s history, its ground-breaking ceremony was held in July 1991, as almost 3,000 tonnes of Bulgarian limestone were shipped 3,900 miles to India along with 1,200 tonnes of Italian Carrara marble, which made its own journey of 4,800 miles. With a further 900 tonnes of Indian Ambaji marble, the over 5,000 tonnes of stone was hand-carved by more than 1,500 skilled artisans at 14 different sites around India into 26,300 pieces. MPs Dawn Butler and Gareth Thomas (both Labour) and Bob Blackman (Conservative) were among those hailing the anniversary of the temple, where leading politicians invariably join ‘arti’ and other rituals before elections to seek support of the community.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/21/25-years-of-Shri-Swaminarayan-Mandir-in-London.html
The crisis of a lifetime and lessons from Ramayana, 09-May-2020,,"CV Srikar Deserted streets; trains transferring migrant workers; poor and the needy being fed by strangers; the ‘party animals’ stuck in houses; and, an invisible virus. As much as one would have been happy seeing such scenarios only in motion pictures, they are a reality now. For the people of my generation, especially those early in their career, this is a major speed breaker! We never imagined such a thing could ever happen. But it did. Many have become unemployed. Many still are hanging by the cliff, to be pushed by the management any time. But crisis is not a new thing in human life. One human’s opportunity is another’s crisis. Several thousand years ago, another man, or perhaps a superman, faced a series of crises in his life. For a prince, this was unlike anything ever seen. Especially, to make his newlywed wife share the crises, adds further agony to the prince. This superman was Lord Rama. His life is a study in resilience and courage. Perhaps, for an ordinary human, the sufferings faced by Rama, in the age that he was born, is unparalleled. That is the reason why we call him God or, the supreme human. Here, I try to put forth three episodes from Valmiki Ramayana, lessons which may be useful for us, as we deal with this Covid-19 crisis. From coronation to expatriation. Even as Kausalya, Lakshman, Sita and almost all of the Ayodhya were preparing for the coronation, right on that day, Ram is asked to go on a fourteen-year exile in the forests of Dandakaranya. If there was another prince, surely, he would have killed his brother, imprisoned his father and declared himself the king. Not Rama. For him, there was another important thing to uphold-Dharma, loosely translated as righteousness.Rama knew that if he did such a rebellion, as Lakshman was instigating Rama to do, it will set a bad example to the people of Bharata and a bad name for the entire Ikshvaku dynasty. Rama was seeing super long-term repercussions of his acts and therefore stayed on the path of order and righteousness and therefore, accepted everything as they came. Here, Rama at least had a choice. But, we, today, sitting in this crisis do not much have a choice. Rama says to Lakshman- धर्मःहिपरमःलोकेधर्मेसत्यम्प्रतिष्ठितम्| [Righteousness is the best of all qualities in the world. Truth is established in righteousness.] Therefore, all we can do is to follow our dharma. For youth, it means to put the infinite energy of their age in serving the country and the society. We have to serve the senior citizens; we have to hand-hold the children and if possible, teach them to make up for the lost classes; we have to support the poor people, wherever and whenever we can; we have to use our creativity to make new, useful inventions for the country. This way, we are one step ahead of the crisis and not the other way round. Hanuman’s assurance to Sugreeva The Sanskrit for the above warning given by Hanuman is as below- बुद्धिविज्ञानसंपन्नइङ्गितैःसर्वम्आचर | नहिअबुद्धिम्गतोराजासर्वभूतानिशास्तिहि || Today, during these highly uncertain times, many of us are understandably afraid. However, such fear should not lead to fickleness of mind; Sugreeva assumed, out of fear, that Rama and Lakshman are assassins sent by Bali. Had there been no Hanuman, Sugreeva may have attacked Ram and Lakshman and Ramayana would have ended differently. All based on essentially a fake news of that era.  Today such fear should not prompt us to spread fake news, which may harm many people and disturb the order in the society. We saw how doctors, other healthcare workers and police personnels were attacked based on fake news. This is especially uncalled for in public leaders for if they spread fake news and create chaos, it will lead to people losing trust in those leaders as Hanuman warns Sugreeva. Ram Setu and the possibility of the impossible विषाण्णाहरयःसर्वेहनुमन्किम्उपेक्षसे | विक्रमस्वमहावेगविष्णुःत्रीन्विक्रमान्इव || [Oh, Hanuma, all these monkeys are dispirited. Why this laziness of yours? You boldly triumph over the ocean as your speed is highest, supersonic, super-photic, super-cerebric is your speed. As with Vishnu who walked the troika of worlds in a moment, you too triumph over..."" Thus, Jambavanta persuaded Hanuman to get ready for action.] Today, there are many such Hanumans and Nalas in India, who need to be reminded about their hidden talents and abilities. Some very talented Indians are hiding in plain sight. We can see such Indians, who are highly creative, and yet somehow the country is not able to get their talents harnessed properly. They need to reminded that their ancestors were such great humans as Aryabhatta, Sushruta, Baudhayana among others. It is time, that such Indians are recognized and their talents put to national service. Many Indians abroad are also exceptionally talented and have international exposure. Such Indians also need to join the national efforts in rebuilding India. This Covid crisis has definitely challenged India and Indians. Many of us have lost loved ones, jobs, or normal life. But, this also an opportunity to collectively create a New India. This is the time to participate in rebuilding the Vikas Setu being set forth by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is time to make attempts to once again build a Ram Rajya in Bharat!",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/5/9/The-crisis-of-a-lifetime-and-lessons-from-Ramayana.html

Guru Arjan Dev Ji: Martyrdom for righteousness that changed the course of History, 26-May-2020,,"The martyrdom of the fifth master of the Sikhs, Guru Arjan Dev Ji , in the hands of the cruel and bigoted Mughal regime on 13 Jeth 1606 (30 May 1606) falls on 26 May by the western calendar this year. - Jaibans Singh & Jaspal Singh The martyrdom of the fifth master of the Sikhs, Guru Arjan Dev Ji , in the hands of the cruel and bigoted Mughal regime on 13 Jeth 1606 (30 May 1606) falls on 26 May by the western calendar this year. It was a watershed moment not only in the history of the Sikhs but also the whole of India. This victory of righteousness over evil spelled the beginning of the end of the mighty Mughal empire and the rise of the Sikhs as a proud, courageous and upright community. Guru Arjan Dev Ji, was a visionary scholar, poet, philosopher, composer of music, administrator with excellent organising ability and eminent statesman. Guru Arjan Dev Ji was born at Goindwal Sahib on April 15, 1563. His father was Bhai Jetha Ji (later Guru Ram Das Ji) and mother was Bibi Bhani Ji the daughter of Guru Amar Das Ji. He was the youngest of three siblings. His two elder brothers were Prithi Mal and Maha Dev. He became Guru at the young age of 18 on September 1, 1581. Guru Arjan Dev Ji brought about many changes in the spiritual and temporal aspects of the Sikh community. The most prominent among these were construction of the holy temple Harimandir Sahib at Amritsar and compilation of the Bani (religious literature) of Sikh masters and other prominent saints, into a single holy scripture – the Adi Granth. These noble contributions of the Guru to led to a rapid evolution of the Sikh community and became the main reason for his imprisonment, torture and martyrdom. Not to ignore, of course, the other reasons, personal and political, that led to the terrible tragedy. During the reign of Emperor Akbar, the Guru had very good relations with the ruling Mughal monarchy and administration.  Abul Fazal, the court historian of Emperor Akbar writes in Akbar Namah (official history of Emperor Akbar)  that the Emperor visited the Guru at Goindwal on 24th November, 1598. He took a round of the commune and also partook Langar (community food) that he was particularly interested in. The Emperor was so impressed that, on the recommendation of the Guru, he ordered to reduce revenue being paid by Punjab. In the course of his ministry, the Guru cultivated many enemies. Some like his brother Prithi Chand, who had aspired to become Guru and Chandu Shah, a senior noble in the Mughal court, who held a grudge against the Guru due to the broken marriage alliance of his daughter with Hargobind, the son of the Guru, were antagonistic due to personal reasons. Others like Sulhi Khan, a revenue officer in the imperial administration were influenced against the Guru by Prithi Chand and Chandu Shah. The most significant among the Gurus enemies was the Muslim clergy that felt threatened by his rising religious acceptance among the masses. The chief among these was Sheikh Ahmed Faruqi Sirhindi, a cleric of the all powerful of Naqshbandi order of Sirhind who also held the title of Qayum (Deputy of God). He looked upon himself as a revivalist of the Islamic order in Punjab and wished to destroy the Guru and the Sikh faith. The original manuscript of the Adi Granth was installed at Harimandir Sahib on 16 August, 1604. Within no time, the protagonists aligned against the Guru  started conniving to use the holy book as an instrument to harm him and the Sikhs. They lodged a complaint with Emperor Akbar that the holy Granth contained passages that were blasphemous to Islam. The Emperor called for the Granth, which was sent to him by the Guru in custody of Bhai Gurdas Ji and Baba Buddha Ji. They were assisted by Mian Mir who was revered by Emperor Akbar as a great Saint. Akbar was satisfied that the contents were, by no means, against any religion let alone Islam. He termed the scripture as a  “volume worthy of reverence.”  and made an offering of 51 gold coins to the Granth. The death of Emperor Akbar in October, 1605, led to a succession battle between his son Prince Salim and grandson Prince Khusrau. Prince Khusrau travelled towards Lahore and en-route at Taran Taran he met with and received blessings from Guru Arjan Dev Ji. He was defeated by his father and blinded. Prince Salim thus became Emperor and took the name of Jahangir. For the enemies of Guru Arjan Dev Ji, this was a golden opportunity! They filled the ears of Emperor Jahangir telling him that the Guru had aligned with his enemy. Their ministrations found support from many powerful Muslim clergymen who were getting worried by the growing spiritual influence of the Sikh religion and Guru Arjan Dev Ji on the common people, especially so, after the compilation of the holy Granth and construction of the Harimandir Sahib in Amritsar. These forces were successful in filling the ears of the Emperor who was already opposed to all those who had been good books of Emperor Akbar and those who has assisted his son in the battle for the throne. Jahangir was barely in the second year of his reign when he ordered the arrest of Guru Arjan Dev Ji. The justification for the same is contained in his autobiography Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri. He records in the autobiography that Arjan in the garments of sainthood and sanctity had captured many simple minded Hindus as well as ignorant and foolish Muslims who had been persuaded to adopt his ways and manners. Jahangir termed the spirituality of Sikh Guru’s as a shop – an exercise for profit. He further admitted that he had it in mind for some time to “stop to this vain affair or to bring him into the assembly of the people of Islam.” It becomes quite apparent that the Emperor was interested in converting the Guru to Islam and nipping in the bud the Sikh religion once and for all  and before  meeting the Guru he was already prejudiced against.  By his own admission in his autobiography he used the Guru’s meeting with Prince Khusrau as an excuse to order the arrest. Thus, while the personal enmity of some with the Guru is mostly quoted as the reason behind his arrest and subsequent murder, the actual reason were political and religious insecurities of the Muslim regime and clergy that has, for long, chaffed at the tolerance of Emperor Akbar. Emperor Jahangir would want the world to believe that he considered Guru Arjan Dev Ji to be an insignificant irritant but deep down he was very worried by the hundreds of thousands of the people, both Hindus and Muslims, who had started following the teachings of Sikhism and were crowding into Goindwal and Amritsar. When the Guru received summons to the court of Jahangir, he realised that he would probably not come back. Accordingly, as per established rituals, he anointed his son Hargobind as the sixth Nanak. Guru Arjan Dev Ji explained to Emperor Jahangir that he had simply extended courtesy to Prince Khusrau since the latter was the grandson of Emperor Akbar who had shown great respect for the Guru while remaining a benefactor of the Sikhs. He emphasised that there was no political intention on his part. Emperor Jahangir failed to comprehend the high spiritual standing of the Guru and remained unconvinced about the explanation given. He rendered a death sentence to the Guru on the charge of rebellion. In his autobiography Jahangir records that he ordered his Governor of Lahore, Murtaza Khan, to confiscate all properties of the guru and put him to death. Since there is no historical evidence of such confiscation it was either an idle boast or the Governor was scared of the Sikhs and as such did not go to Goindwal to confiscate the properties. Mian Mir intervened and convinced the Emperor to commute the sentence to a fine of Rupees Two Lakhs plus erasing of a few verses from the Adi Granth which the Emperor had been told were objectionable to the clergy. Guru Arjan Dev Ji refused both the caveats. He said the money of the Sikhs could not be spent for his personal benefit. He was ready to give whatever he possessed personally, but that was not enough. The Sikhs attempted to give the fine but the Guru issued a stern warning that whosoever contributed to pay the fine would not be his Sikh. On changing the verses in the Adi Granth the Guru was emphatic that not a single word of what has been said by the saints and holy people could be changed especially so since the hymns were not disrespectful to any Hindu incarnation or any Muslim prophet. The Guru was imprisoned in Lahore Fort and brutally tortured over five days under the supervision of Chandu Shah. On the first day he was given nothing to eat or drink; on the second day he was burnt in a cauldron of boiling water; on the third day he was once again boiled in water while hot sand was poured on his head. His friend and devotee, Mian Mir, was so devastated by the barbarity that he sought permission to use his supernatural and ecclesiastic powers to destroy the torturers and the entire city of Lahore. The Guru strictly forbade him from doing so since the use of such power goes against the tenets of the Sikh religion. The torture thus continued for the fourth day when the Guru was made to sit on a plate of heated iron while hot sand was poured on his upper body. The Guru went through the torture in an absolutely calm manner, taking the name of the lord all the time and saying “Tera Kiya Meetha Lage, Nam Padarth Nanak Mange” (your will is sweet nectar for me, I desire only the gift of your name) . On the fifth day he asked for permission to bathe in the River Ravi. The torturers felt that the cold water on his blistered body will cause more pain so they gave permission. As soon as Guru Arjan Dev Ji entered the River, he simply disappeared; his body was nowhere to be seen. The martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev Ji became a watershed moment for the Sikhs.  Guru Arjan Dev Ji had also enjoined his son Guru Hargobind to “sit fully armed on his throne and maintain an army to the best of his ability.” Guru Hargobind adhered to the direction and initiated the concept of Miri and Piri, which gave to the Guru both spiritual and temporal powers, he wore two swords to indicate his dual powers and raised an Army from among his followers. The Sikhs decided that they would never again tolerate injustice, insult or oppression. Like all Sikh Guru’s before him, Guru Arjan Dev Ji taught the message of compassion, love dedication, hard work, the worship of one God the commitment to peace and harmony for all the peoples of the world, but, in his death he created the strongest influence on the Sikh religion.

Amidst this chaos, the healthcare worker is being guided by dharma and a deep sense of purpose to do what is right and not become paralysed by the outcome,” says  “Krishna’s advice to Arjuna was simple. Being a warrior committed to protecting his people, Arjuna’s only dharma was to fight, and not worry who he was fighting or the outcome of the war. To be able to do what is needed without becoming attached to the result is the way of living a skilful life. To have a goal is not the problem—to become so entangled in the goal where the action is tainted lends itself to suffering,” reads the article titled ""Lessons from the Bhagavad Gita (the ‘Lord’s Song’), from India during these difficult times"". “The famous archer Arjuna, the hero of this story, was caught in a moral dilemma. He was sure that he was on the side of dharma but could not imagine fighting his loved ones. ‘I quit’, he said. Fortunately for him, his charioteer was Krishna, an embodiment of dharma. In what would come to be known as the Bhagavad Gita (the ‘Lord’s Song’), Krishna taught Arjuna the ways of skilful living.

500-year-old Odisha temple submerged in Mahanadi River resurfaces, 14-Jun-2020,,"A 500-year-old ancient Hindu temple that remained submerged in Mahanadi River in Odisha has been resurfaced. The 60-feet temple, believed to be around 500 years old, was located recently during an exercise as part of the project, said Anil Dhir, project coordinator of the Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (INTACH) in Odisha, reported PTI. The temple was found in the mid-river near Baideswar in the Padmavati area in Cuttack. The temple dates back to the late 15th or early 16th century, considering the construction style of the Mastaka and the materials used for the construction, Dhir said, adding that INTACH would approach the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to take steps for relocating and restoring the temple. We will soon write to the ASI requesting it to take steps to relocate the temple to a suitable site. They have the required technology to do it. The state government should also take up the matter with the ASI, PTI quoted Dhir as saying. Deepak Kumar Nayak ""Lord Gopinath’s Submerged Temple: The detailed story"" This is a story that depicts the cruel side of mighty Mahanadi which once swallowed down a happy habitat into its humongous mouth. ""Satapatana"" a combination of seven neighbouring localities was located just in the bank of Mahanadi about 7kms away from Baideswar of Kataka district. It is said that the width of Mahanadi was very narrow those days, but then came the worst time for the residents when the cruel river shifted its course  towards the locality and gradually flooded Satapatana living the locals totally hopeless. The desperate locals then shifted themselves to the nearby regions having higher elevation above the river level. Their villages and houses were underwater now, they took all their religious idols, deities along with them and new temples were constructed later on for those deities. The earlier temples also went under the water along with the houses of villagers. It is said that there are more than 20 temples in the region between Baideswar to Kantilo are still present down under the water of Mahanadi. Among all those flood affected temples Gopinath Deva Temple of Padmabati village in Bhapur block of Nayagarh district was possibly the tallest one. Although, the temple is buried in sand of Mahanadi, very seldom the sands are removed with the flow of flood water of Mahanadi to provide locals few rare glimpses of that majestic temple which their ancestors had once built. After 11 long years that special moment came when this summer the dome section of that submerged temple was visible for a short period of time. About 3 months back I got a phone call from my good friend & heritage explorer Sri Rabindra Rana about this. I knew about few submerged temples of Sambalpur near Hirakud Dam, but hearing about a submerged temple in the lower-central region of Mahanadi valley was an exceptional thing to me. I instantly called on my Project Coordinator Sri Anil Dhir to explore this place and list it as one of the monument in our campaign ""Mahanadi Valley Heritage Sites Documentation"". Anil Sir was also agreed and we planned to visit the place within next 3 days. However, our planning got spoil as Lock down was declared due to ongoing Covid19 crisis. Soon after Lock down was reduced and things were bit settled I went to the spot with Rana Babu thrice. But all the time, we found the temple merged inside water. We left hope and thought it is no more possible to document this place. However, surprisingly on the evening of 7th June, I was informed by Rana Babu that just a thin part of the Dome (Amalaka) section of the temple is probably visible from last couple of days as the water level is little bit down. I got totally refreshed and asked Anil Sir's final permission whether to start documenting the spot. Unfortunately, Sir was away from Bhubaneswar and was unable to join me next day. But he insisted me to list the place if possible. Next morning, I left home early in the morning and reached Baideswar market by 7 AM where Rana Babu was waiting for me. We reached Balunkeswar temple of Padmabati village from where one needs to cross the river to reach the spot where the temple is found. We hired a small boat of a fisherman; the priests of Balunkeswar temple were all gentlemen and sweet-speaking persons. One of the priests was agreed to join us and guided us to the other side of Mahanadi. We were totally unsure whether we will be able to see the temple, however within 10 minutes our boat reached there and was taking circumference around the Mastaka section that was visible. We tried to take some photograph; it was not that easy, the small boat was in a shaking state with water waves making its effect after getting obstructed by the dome of the temple. The priest then did an incredible thing; he climbed on to Dadhinauti section of the temple and held the boat in his hand to provide us few static moments to click few photographs. The pictures attached here were generated with very tough efforts. We hardly spent 5-7 minutes at the spot and returned back. We found the mastaka section of the submerged temple huge and understood why it gets visible at times. It was possibly a Temple having a Vimana and Jagamohana. The Vimana was in Rekha Deula style and Jagamohana was of Pidha order. The stone materials used to construct this temple are generally seen in temples of 15th/16th Century. When the region was merged under water, there were several deities those get shifted. Notable among them were Gopinath, Nrusingha, Rasa Bihari, Kamana Devi & Dadhibamana. All of these deities are still worshipped in Padmabati village other than the Dadhibamana shrine who is worshipped in nearby Tikiripada village. We then moved on to present day Gopinath temple of Padmabati village where the original shrine of Lord Gopinath is worshipped after being moved from the river. We saw a plaque at the entrace of this temple mentioning this temple was constructed by Bebarta Keshab Pattanaik of Khandapada Gada in the year 1850. Worshipping of flute playing Lord Krishna in the forms of Gopinath, Rasabihari, Madan Mohana, Nikunja Bihari etc. were mainly developed during late Gajapati period after King Purushottama Deva brought the beautiful idol of Sakhi Gopinath from Kanchi to Kataka. Though, smaller in size we found the iconographical construction of this particular shrine very much similar to any other Flute playing Krishna shrine of Gajapati era. Yesterday, when I posted few images through my FB accounts, I got around 15 queries (via emails, comments and phone calls) asking me whether some part of the temple is underwater!! I understood it was creating confusion. So, I put my observations through a rough sketch (please refer image no-2 in this post), it depicts the possible position with which the Temple currently stands in the middle of Mahanadi. We assume, the temple was possibly rising to a height of 60 feet. Out of which 50/55 feet is underlying the sand just beneath the flowing water, rest 5 feet i.e. the rising part of the temple or the Mastaka section is submerged in water, out of which only 10 inches is above water, currently. That is what I observe, though it's entirely my personal assumption and I might be wrong. So this was the total story. Practically if we see there is nothing much to do with this older submerged temple. However, it was a spot telling many eventful tales from the past especially highlighting human struggle and survival against all negative acts of natural calamities.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/14/500-year-old-Odisha-temple-submerged-in-Mahanadi-River-resurfaces.html
#InternationalYogaDay How yoga strengthened the Saudi woman’s steely resolve, 21-Jun-2020,Nilima Pathak,"In 2018, Nouf Almarwaai tweeted, “Thank you Rashtrapati Bhawan for the honour. I dedicate this award to my beloved country Saudi Arabia and all the people who supported me. I pray to God that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and India prosper and flourish in all fields, as India is my second home.” The President of India Ram Nath Kovind had conferred Nouf with the fourth-highest civilian award the Padma Shree. The first certified yoga instructor in the region, she was credited for getting yoga recognized as a sports activity in Saudi Arabia. She said that the honour and trust the Indian government bestowed on her, was a “big responsibility” on her shoulders. She pledged to never stop practising and promoting yoga, which she has been doing for over two decades. Who is Nouf Marwaai? A leading practitioner and the official promoter of yoga in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, Nouf is a Saudi businesswoman and entrepreneur. She is also a practitioner of Ayurvedic Indian medicine and lifestyle counselor. Removing misconceptions Initially, when Nouf started practising yoga in her hometown Riyadh, in Saudi Arabia, she found people enquiring whether it was a Buddhist practice like meditation. She faced strong opposition from people belonging to the Muslim community in certain South Asian countries, as some had misconceptions about yoga in relation to the Islamic culture. The woman yoga master stressed, “I would again like to clarify that yoga asanas are practised for physical and mental well-being. No yoga institution makes you do any kind of worship. As now, back then also I explained its benefits and how it brings about a positive change in a person’s outlook towards life.” Personal journey Nouf’s yoga journey began in 1998 when she was 18-years-old. She was born and diagnosed with lupus, an auto-immune disease due to which she was unable to lead a normal lifestyle. Nouf had to stay away from school and was restricted from heavy sports and strenuous activities because of muscle and joint pains, stiffness, inflammation and fatigue. All this impacted her and caused a lot of stress. She informed, “Someone told me about yoga and on a visit to Mecca, I stumbled upon a book on the discipline, and bought it. On reading and researching further, I saw a silver lining. Through books and videos, I grasped whatever best I could.” Life-altering effects On practising a few yoga postures, she felt the difference in her health condition. While studying at the King Saud University in Riyadh, she was able to attend regular classes and passed with good grades. Nouf shared, “Yoga had a life-altering effect on me and I started feeling energetic. I was a volunteering psychologist at a mental health hospital in Jeddah. But after completing my yoga certifications, people began approaching me to teach them the medium, even though I had no intention of taking it up as a career. “Some of my relatives wanted me to ‘stop this nonsense’, as they called it and instructed me to focus on going to the US for further studies, as I was nominated for a scholarship.” Changing mindsets Nouf would have none of it and decided to teach and promote yoga. In 2004, she founded the Saudi Arabia Yoga School in Jeddah, which, in 2010, was named the Arab Yoga Foundation, the first official centre in the Gulf region. The trained psychologist presented the medical, scientific and economical facts to support her cause. She conducted awareness campaigns through TV shows and spoke about various mental and physical health issues and how yoga and meditation could help overcome these concerns. “Since for many in Saudi Arabia, it was a new concept, irrespective of the age group, they became enthusiastic about it,” Nouf divulged. “While many began practising quietly in the confines of their homes, others taught privately in their workspaces,” she added. “Imagine, those very relatives who had opposed me later came to my clinic for Ayurvedic treatment, dietary and lifestyle consultation, and back pain therapy!” she chided. In 2007, Nouf went to Australia to complete her studies. By then, her illness had started to attack her kidneys. India beckons In 2008, she made her first trip to Kerala, India, and met some Ayurvedic doctors. Impressed by the treatment methods, Nouf decided not to live with her illness anymore. In the years that followed, she mastered the art of yoga with renowned ashtanga and hatha (types of yoga) under illustrious yoga gurus in Coonoor, Tamil Nadu, New Delhi and the Himalayas. She achieved the status of Yogacharinie Nouf Marwaai, a title awarded in Kerala. In 2014, she was diagnosed with early stagebreast cancer. But with yoga as a tool, she battled with the disease. “Yoga is the need of the hour, because it is a ‘costless’ holistic wellness treatment,” she declared. Yoga as ‘wellness sport’ Witnessing a change in people’s attitude towards yoga, she felt a strong need to regulate it as a sport. Without losing time, she set out to change things at the ground level. Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, President of the Community Sports Federation supported Nouf in her mission. In November 2017, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Commerce and Investment officially approved the teaching of yoga as a sport. Elaborating on the subject, she explained, “By practising yoga asanas and breathing techniques,one imbibes the elements of sports physically and physiologically. Still, it is different as far as its depth and benefits are concerned. “In fact, just one session of the breath control asana can affect the neurological and biological levels of a person. Followed by savasana (relaxation exercise), it helps calm the nervous system and reduces the stress hormones. Furthermore, the meditation techniques enhance the feeling of spirituality in a person.” Shaping lives She said that people often question her on whether yoga is a sport or sadhana (dedicated practice) or a therapy. To that, her response is: ‘It is all of that and can be studied and practised as a science of movement and wellbeing.’ Nouf said her life revolves around yoga. “I have coached more than 10,000 people in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. I practice 7 days a week and teach for more than 8 hours a day between theory and practice.All my travels are associated with yoga – whether it is to teach or to learn.” Learn? But haven’t you achieved the perfection stage? Nouf laughs, “It is not possible to attain perfection in yoga. One can only perfect the discipline. It is a life-long learning process and I am still exploring.” Nouf’s dedication has resulted in yoga being practiced in several Saudi Arabian cities including Riyadh, Jeddah, Damman, Taif, Mecca and Medina, where yoga centres and yoga teachers are much in demand. Her mission is to provide educational and training courses to students who are keen to learn more about this ancient Indian science.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/21/Nouf-Marwaai.html
"#InternationalYogaDay Yoga is a moving meditation, where practice becomes prayer and dedication: Yasmina Cherquaoui", 21-Jun-2020,Nilima Pathak,"London-based Yasmina Cherquaoui’s foray with yoga began in 2002. While trying to find balance in a stress-filled corporate world, the yoga mat became a secret haven for her. A qualified health and nutrition coach, she teaches yoga at studios in London, has corporate and private clients and runs retreats in the United Kingdom, Portugal, Turkey, Morocco and the Caribbean. Yasmina also works in co-ordination with Dr Imran Ali, a renowned osteopathic and naturopathic practitioner at The London Clinic (www.thelondonclinic.co.uk). She acknowledged, “Dr Ali has a unique integrated treatment programme. He prescribes yoga to some of his patients as part of the rehabilitation programme to complement the treatment they receive from him. “In fact, the various yogic breathing techniques he has been applying for the past few months, have been very helpful for Covid-19 patients, who were earlier on a mechanical ventilator and later recovered.” Founder of Ready Steady Glow, a wellness store in London, Yasmina shares with Organiser, her nearly two decades of yoga experience. How did it begin? It was around 2002 while working as a PR consultant with a hotel chain that I had scoliosis (curvature of the spine caused by bad desk posture). In the midst of uncertainty, chaos, stress and anxiety, I was unnerved and did not know how to feel grounded. I suffered from panic attacks. That’s when my mother who had heard about the benefits of yoga introduced me to it. I began practising a few asanas and within a few weeks, felt the change. The asanas were helping my medical condition. The practices astounded me on how yoga could positively affect me both mentally and physically. The practice of pranayama had a calming effect on my mind and transformed the way I lived life. Sabbatical from job To me, it was nothing short of a miracle and I wanted to learn more. It was not just about the asanas, but the history and philosophy of yoga, the art of well-being, that I wanted to imbibe. I took a sabbatical from my job in 2014and underwent a 200-hour teacher-training course in hatha yoga,at the Himalayan Yoga Institute in India. On completion, I decided to share the knowledge and benefits with others. The idea was to help people discover the incredible effects of yoga. I began teaching at a local community centre and my perspective towards life changed. The turnaround I shifted my life in the direction it was taking me. Within a year, I quit the corporate job and became a full-time practitioner and yoga teacher. From yoga guru Shiva Rea, I learned prana vinyasa, an energetic and creative dance flow, soma prana, a restorative and healing practice, chakra mandala, conscious process of self-discovery, sound healing, mindfulness meditation and pre and postnatal yoga. I consider it a blessing and an honour to be able to share my love of yoga with others. While being respectful towards the ancient traditional teachings, I make yoga applicable to the modern lifestyle. Through my concepts, I try to provide solace to people and relieve them of stress in their everyday life. Area of specialisation I am fascinated by hypnobirthing - a method of pain management that can be used during labour and birth. It involves using a mixture of visualization, relaxation and deep-breathing techniques. Sadly, these days, women, especially in western countries, have begun to rely heavily on medical intervention during pregnancy. Staying connected to the present moment and releasing tension from the body is imperative for successful labour. Some asanas are very helpful during pregnancy and can relieve lower back pain and the tension in neck and shoulders. These can also improve a person’s posture and sciatica effects. Closer to and during labour, certain hip opening asanas are extremely beneficial. Why yoga is necessary? What is readily known and attracts people is merely a scratch on the surface. Yoga is much more than making poses! It is a moving meditation, where practice becomes a prayer and dedication towards it becomes sacred to every individual who practices it.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/21/Yasmina-Cherquaoui.html
Yoga Day is a day of solidarity and universal brotherhood; Yoga boosts immune system against Covid 19 virus: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on #InternationalYogaDay, 21-Jun-2020,,,https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/21/Prime-Minister-Narendra-Modi-on-InternationalYogaDay.html
6th International Day of Yoga celebrated across the country through Digital Media, 21-Jun-2020,,"The sixth International Day of Yoga was celebrated with great enthusiasm across the country through electronic and digital media. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, addressing the nation on this occasion, underlined the role of Yoga in strengthening the family bondage. He said that Yoga brings all closer and binds every member of a family including children and elders. This is the reason  why ‘Yoga with Family’ has been made the theme of this year's IDY. The Prime Minister further said that  COVID-19 mainly attacks the pulmonary organs of the human body and Pranayams are helpful in strengthening the respiratory system. He said, “If we can finetune our chords of health and hope, the day is not far away when the world will witness the success of healthy and happy humanity. Yoga can definitely help us make this happen.” Due to current pandemic of COVID-19, mass gatherings on IDY are not advisable. Keeping this situation in mind, the Government encouraged people to practice Yoga at their homes along with their family members. In this regard, the Ministry of AYUSH maximized the use of social and digital media platforms to facilitate online participation from the people.    On this occasion, the Minister of State for AYUSH,  Shri Shripad Naik said that International Day of Yoga has turned into the biggest public health movement. ""Now every country of the world celebrates IDY and the public has embraced this event and adopting it as a celebration of India’s culture and tradition"", he stated.  The Minister said that this year IDY comes in the middle of a health emergency so  the AYUSH Ministry  has been fostering and facilitating the trend of practicing Yoga at home through various online and hybrid-online initiatives since the last three months. The Minister praised “My Life – My Yoga” Video Blogging Contest announced by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji for raising awareness about Yoga. Shri Naik further added that many leading Yoga institutions have joined forces with the Ministry in this effort. Such activities intensified in the last one month, with added focus of training in Common Yoga Protocol (CYP), which is followed by participants of IDY every year for ensuring harmony in the mass demonstrations of Yoga. While giving the vote of thanks Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha said that in the new scenario, the aim of IDY is to focus on its health- rewards and to do Yoga at home on Yoga Day. The Ministry of AYUSH is supporting this trend by promoting the theme “Yoga at Home, Yoga with Family” in its IDY activities. Shri Kotecha said that the Ministry of AYUSH streamed various online initiatives including daily morning CYP session on Doordarshan and social media for people to follow and learn the Protocol. The Secretary said that numerous individuals and institutions including educational institutions, government bodies, business firms, industries and cultural organizations have committed themselves to joining IDY for the benefit of their employees, members or other stakeholders, from their homes itself. Through such efforts the Yoga fraternities in different parts of the country are now ready to observe IDY with thousands of families joining the same from their respective homes, the Secretary added. He also informed about  Ayush Sanjivani mobile app for generating data of large population with a target of 5 million people. The core expected outcomes include generating data on acceptance and usage of AYUSH advocacies, and measures among the population and its impact in prevention of COVID 19. At the end of the programme, live demonstration of Common Yoga Protocol was performed by the experts of Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga followed by discussions with Yoga experts. The programme was televised on all the channels of Doordarshan.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/21/6th-International-Day-of-Yoga-celebrated-across-the-country-through-Digital-Media.html
"Yoga is a deep spiritual system, a journey into ancient India", 21-Jun-2020,,"Purnima Nath Although Yoga has become a global symbol of physical exercise and perfect body in the mainstream today, it is far greater than asanas (postures). In today's temporary-body-centric world, yoga lost its original form of deep spiritual significance. Yoga is the union of finite to the infinite, connection of manifest to unmanifest, integration and harmony between thoughts, feelings, words, and deeds; and total balance of mind, body, and spirit; uniting individual soul to the divine soul to achieve utmost stability and state of enlightenment through physical, mental, intellectual, and spiritual awakening. Yoga is pure science and a sophisticated and comprehensive eastern system of developing a person’s Chetana (consciousness). But how yoga got launched in the western world? On this International Yoga Day, we will establish facts of the interrelatedness of Hinduism to yoga. We will further look at some examples of how the western world is refusing its origin and dismissing its contribution, and pushing a negative connotation of Hindu affiliation and association with India. YOGA AND HINDUISM: ‘Yoga’ comes from a Sanskrit word – ‘yuj’, meaning ‘to join’, ‘to yoke’, ‘to subjugate’, ‘to connect’, or ‘to unite’. To understand the origin of yoga, we must dig into the history of Hinduism. Hinduism comes from the Vedic tradition of Sanatana Dharma, the eternal truth. The concept of 'eternal existence' derives from the soul. Our soul might leave our body at a certain point in our lifetime (the event is called death), however, the soul lives on - an extremely important ideology to note here. Hindu belief system revolves around the emphasis of Karma (deeds). The idea of morality that drives our deeds becomes even more critical for the Hindu belief system. Meaning, our karma accumulates ‘memories’ and transfers from birth, to rebirth and reincarnation. An individual soul’s optimum goal is to attain moksha (mukti, liberation, salvation, release, emancipation, enlightenment) from the pain and sufferings caused by the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Our body is the only vehicle for attaining moksha. Hence, our thoughts, words, deeds, and actions must all be aligned. In that context, yoga is the technique, science and art of achieving the pinnacle of alignment of mind, body, and spirit. ORIGIN OF YOGA: 3500 - 1500 BCE: The Pashupati Seal is a steatite seal was discovered  It is said that Lord Shiva, the destroyer of worlds, is the supreme first yogic guru, known as the Adiyogi, the source of yoga. Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma) is older than 5000+ years.  We certainly can connect Yoga to 5000 years old Indus valley civilizational evidence. A famous clay seal excavated where a yogi is seated on lotus posture of meditation (3500 – 1700 BCE Mahenjo-Daro and Harappan civilization of Indus Valley). 3500 - 1500 BCE: The Pashupati Seal is a steatite seal was discovered at the Mohenjo-daro archaeological site of the Indus Valley Civilization. The seal depicts a seated figure that is possibly tricephalic (having three heads). 3500 - 1500 BCE: The Pashupati Seal is a steatite seal was discovered at the Mohenjo-daro archaeological site of the Indus Valley Civilization. The seal depicts a seated figure that is possibly tricephalic (having three heads). It is believed that Rig Veda was written by Rishi Vyasa somewhere in between 1750 – 1500 BCE. This is the oldest sacred text of the world, and written mantras, hymns, meditations, and pranayama mentions about yoga. Note that, our ancestors preserved ancient wisdom of hymns (a group of poems from the Rig Veda), literature, and learnings orally and passed on through the many generations. Therefore, it is safe to say that, yogic practices were prevalent even before Rig Veda was written. Upanishad also mentioned yoga (1500 – 1100 BCE). Rishi Patanjali is the father of Yoga. Although he is not the inventor of yogic practices, he certainly the one who gathered all the knowledge under “Yoga Sutras” (500 – 200 BCE), as the definitive guide to Yogic wisdom. Our ‘itihasa’ (history) books such as Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavad Geeta (The Holy book of the Hindus) written between 800 – 400 BCE. Three types of yoga are mentioned in Bhagavat Geeta: Karma - Deeds, Jnana  – Knowledge, and Bhakti - Devotional. In 2017, scientists discovered a NASA satellite image that showed the floating manmade bridge with 7000 years old rocks placed on 4000 years old sand between India and Sri Lanka. Archeological/geological/oceanographic evidence of this ancient 30 miles long magical Ram Sethu (Adam’s bridge) is located between India and Sri Lanka, a report released by Science Channel, USA, proving Indian text of Ramayana was not a myth. Archaeological evidence of sunken ancient city of Dwaraka, [founded by Lord Krishna, mentioned in the longest epic of Mahabharata, 3182 – 3138 BCE], currently known as the Devabhoomi (Land of the Lord) in Gujrat’s west coast is best-studied underwater sites in India. A visual representation of the timeline of world religions, Vedic texts, and Indian scriptures should help us draw a link between the evidential details of Hinduism, Vedic culture, and origin of yoga and its undeniable continuity. WHY DOES THE WEST DENY THE ORIGIN OF YOGA TO HINDUISM AND INSULT ITS ROOTS? Sadly though, I also have witnessed many degrading comments lately, downplaying direct interconnectedness of Yoga to Hinduism, Hindu tradition, and India. Yoga and meditation are also practised in other India-originated religions such as Buddhism. Yoga is not just merely a random collection of poses, it has a deeper spiritual meaning associated. Note the screenshot of a response to a question posted in quora.com. The topic is, why do people reject the fact that the origin of Yoga is linked to Hinduism? As we can clearly observe that, Mr. Faisal Shafi had conveniently dismissed any relation of Yoga with Hinduism or even to India. He raised several shocking claims about yoga’s tie with Pakistan and bonds with Islam. He further attests that yoga is simply a sport, and forcibly emphasizes some kind of relationship to meditation with Islam, which practically is a nonexistent foreign concept for Islam. He continues to insult Hinduism to the point that, he insists blatantly that Hinduism was Islam originally, and scriptures of Hinduism are common with Islam. Many such disturbing trends and allegations are popping up in every corner these days. Let's look at another example. A western yoga teacher is belittling and discrediting its association with Indian traditions. Additionally, she extends her assertions to linking yoga to Christianity. Originated in India (Hindustan/Bharat) by Hindus dated back to pre-Vedic Indian traditions, I find it extremely disrespectful and humiliating that one chooses to malign and brutally criticize Gods and Goddesses of Hindu religion and traditions and pass such derogatory statements. In our Hindu tradition, a teacher is someone with substance, knowledge, and deep wisdom who is equipped to guide their disciples. For the largest part, we are witnessing an awful trend where western scholars and entrepreneurs would grab the ancient Indian culture, practice, tradition; and patent it in the west and earn money from certain ideas that are not theirs. For instance, turmeric. Lack of respect, honesty, and ethics are hypocritical. Hindu Sanatana Dharma is the only continuous living civilization that has survived, unlike the Aztecs or the Mayans. Despite the merciless and harsh history of invasion and atrocities caused by foreign invaders, and 1000s of years of ruling on the native Indians, India remains the lone country that was not converted into a foreign religion, like Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, and so on. HOW YOGA CAME TO THE WEST? Modern-day influential Indian monk Swami Vivekananda introduced yoga to the western world, especially to America in 1893. His famous speech at Chicago in the parliament of world religion captured the world’s eye and created a stir in the west. Magnanimous portrayal and powerful oration of spiritual superiority of Indian religious traditions won many hearts. He spoke about the world’s religion of various paths but phases of one eternal religion. Although the spiritual essence of yoga is diluted, today, and it is heavily commercialized in the west as mere physical practice and postures, the benefits of yoga are still boundless. Stress reduction, blood pressure control, focus and concentration, reduced rate of aging, centeredness and gentleness, patience, sharp intuition, and improved creativity, are just a few positive health benefits of yoga. It is practiced by millions of westerners currently. 5 common types of yoga are Karma (deeds/actions), Jnana (wisdom/knowledge), Bhakti (devotional), Hatha (physical), and Raja (Royal). 8 limbs of yoga are Yama (restraints), Niyama (self-observances), Asanas (posture), Pranayama (breath control), Pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses), Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation), and Samadhi (Self-realization). Balancing 7 chakras namely, Muladhara (Root chakra), Syadhisthana (Sacral chakra), Manipura (Solar Plexus Chakra), Anahata (Heart chakra), Vishuddha (Throat chakra), Ajna (Third eye chakra), and Sahasrara (Crown chakra) through meditation is supremely beneficial for aligning mind and body. On the 69th session of UN General assembly address on Sept 9th, 2014, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested the date of 21 June for International Yoga Day, as it is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and shares a special significance in many parts of the world. June 21st, 2015 was celebrated the first International Yoga Day in the entire world. IN CONCLUSION: Yoga is the process of complete constancy of the mind. Yoga’s benefits are immeasurable, extensive, and truly undeniable. The best part is anyone can attain these benefits. On this International Yoga Day, we must also revive its root, especially the spiritual purpose of yoga to the union of mind, body and soul, and its deep relationship and profound ties to Hinduism, Hindu traditions, Vedic scriptures and Hindustan (India / Bharat). A clear timeline of historic events established the factual evidence behind all arguments. There should be no doubt about its origin, its connections, and its purpose. Furthermore, deliberate attempts and constant efforts of diluting its connection to Hinduism or India only exposes fruitless propaganda.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/21/Yoga-is-a-deep-spiritual-system.html
Sanskrit: A Language of Science, 05-Jul-2020,Dr Gauri Shankar Gupta,"""The Sanskrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either”—Sir William Jones (1675-1749) Sanskrit is perhaps the oldest and the most prolific language known to mankind. Since the Rigveda- the oldest written scripture in the world is in Sanskrit; the origin of Sanskrit as language must precede the Rigveda. Scholars admit of the considerable influence of Sanskrit on Tamil, Greek and Latin which are considered other ancient languages of the world. Sanskrit is also called the mother of languages as most of the Asian and European languages find their origin in Sanskrit. ‘Indo-European languages’ is a term coined by the Europeans to acknowledge the origin of European languages from Sanskrit. Scholars distinguish between Vedic Sanskrit and its descendant Classical Sanskrit; however, these two varieties are very similar and differ marginally in some points of phonology, grammar, and vocabulary. Scholars and linguists agree that Sanskrit is the most scientific and systematic language; the world has ever known. The Sanskrit alphabets and phonology are most scientific innovations based on human physiology. It is widely believed that Sanskrit mantras, when recited in combination with the sound vibrations, have a specific effect on the mind and the psyche of the individual. The word ‘Sanskrit’ is derived from the conjoining of the prefix ‘Sam’ or ‘samyak’ which means ‘perfectly balanced’, ‘equanimity’, ‘purity’ or ‘sacred’ and ‘krit’ meaning ‘done’ or ‘executed’. The term, therefore, means ‘perfectly done’, ‘perfected’ or ‘refined’. Precisely for this reason, Sanskrit is also called ‘Dev Vani’ or the language of the gods. It is said that Brahma – the Creator, introduced this language to the sages of celestial bodies. Looking at the science, perfection and near mathematical precision of the language, one can easily surmise that it could have been invented only by super-humans. Given its complexity arising due to its perfection and elaborate system of grammar, Sanskrit is not an easy language to learn. Renowned historian and author William Cooke Taylor acknowledges that “to acquire the mastery of this language is almost a labour of a life; its literature seems exhaustless”. Sanskrit is rich in vocabulary, phonology, grammar, and syntax, which remains undiluted to this day despite its antiquity. The sound known assabda (also Nada and Vāc)in Sanskrit is considered as the primal cause of vibration leading to movement of the kinetic energy in the universe. Given the significance of sabda, the purity and perfection of language had acquired a special meaning in ancient India. Sanskrit reflected all that. Considering the exalted status of the language, the people who spoke Sanskrit were considered wise, well-educated and refined. Sanskrit script consists of 52 letters in total, 16 vowels and 36 consonants, all directly linked to human physiology. These 52 letters have never been tweaked or altered and have been constant since the beginning, retaining its unbroken tradition for word formation and pronunciation. I know no other language in the world which has 16 basic sounds and 36 consonants. Sanskrit, therefore, provides the most elaborate and scientific structure and phonetics compared to any other language in the world. (English has only six basic sounds; a, e, i, o, u). Precisely for this reason, Sanskrit is called the mathematical language of the world. Sanskrit text written thousands of years ago could be interpreted and understood without any dilution or alteration in their meaning, which is not the case for most other languages of the world. It is therefore natural that the Sanskrit language has an outstanding place in India’s civilization and culture and is considered as the language of rare sublimity with perfect expression. Origin of Alphabets: 50 of the 52 Sanskrit alphabets have their origin directly from the chakras in human body. The Vishuddh Chakra(विशुद्ध चक्र) with its 16 petals have given birth to 16 vowels as given below. The Anahat Chakra(अनाहट चक्र) with its twelve petals gave birth to first 12 consonants in Sanskrit alphabet as stated below. Next, the Manipur Chakra (मनीपुर चक्र) with its 10 petals has given birth to next 10 consonants in Sanskrit alphabet. Next, the Svadhisthan Chakra (स्वाधिष्ठान चक्र) with its 6 petals has given birth to the next 6 consonants in Sanskrit alphabet. Next, the Muladhar Chakra (मूलाधार चक्र) with its 4 petals has given birth to next 4 consonants as given below. Next, the Ajna Chakra (आज्ञा चक्र)with its two petals has given birth to next two consonants: हं क्षं. The last two consonants त्र and ज्ञ are compound consonants. Phonetics: In order to provide the precision of expression and sound, the Sanskrit has an elaborate system of phonetics which is once again deeply connected to human physiology. Depending on the use ofdifferent mouth organs, both the vowels and the consonants have been divided into five categories namely; gutturals, palatals, labials, cerebrals, and dentals. The group of gutturals is followed by palatal and so on in a systematic way. Gutturals are pronounced with the help of throat, palatals with the help of jaw, cerebrals with the tongue hitting the roof of the mouth, dentals with the help of teeth and the labials are pronounced with the help of lips. In addition, the vowels have also been divided into short and long. This pattern has been explained in the table given below. I know no other language with such a scientific pattern of alphabets. Grammar: The grammar of Classical Sanskrit, created by great grammarian Panini (Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini) is highly sophisticated to ensure that expression is precise, logical and elegant. Sanskrit verbs are conjugated in three persons; first, second and third. Verbs also have three numerical forms; singular, dual and plural. Verbs are expressed in ten tenses and three voices active, middle, passive. There are eight cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive and locative and three genders; masculine, feminine, and neuter. The following is an example of the conjugations of a typical Sanskrit verb: The body of Sanskrit literature encompasses a rich tradition of philosophical, religious, historical, astronomical, medical and scientific texts and poetry, music, drama, mathematics and grammar. In grammar, Panini and Patanjali (authors of Ashtadhyayi and the Mahabhashya) have no equals in the world; in astronomy and mathematics the works of Aryabhatta, Brahmagupta and Bhaskar opened up new frontiers for mankind, as did the works of Charak and Sushrut in medicine (Ayurveda). In philosophy Gautam (founder of the Nyaya system), Ashvaghosha (author of Buddha Charita), Kapila (founder of the Sankhya system) and Shankaracharya present the widest range of philosophical systems, from deeply religious to strongly atheistic. In Sanskrit literature, the works of Kalidas (AbhigyanShakuntalam, Meghdoot, Malavikagnimitra, etc.), Bhavabhuti (Malti Madhav, Uttar Ramcharit, etc.) and the great epics -Ramayana by Valmiki and Mahabharata by Ved Vyas, are known all over the world. These and countless other Sanskrit works kept the light of learning ablaze in India until modern times. This is also the language of all Indic religions; Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. Thus, Sanskrit is an integral part of glorious Indian civilization and Indian ethos. Scientists of modern era consider Sanskrit as the most appropriate language for Artificial Intelligence.

"Houses, temples reverberate with Ram Nam: Holy Ramayana Month begins in Kerala", 16-Jul-2020,,"Reciting the divine story of Bhagwan Sri Ramchandra, the Ramayana month observance began in Kerala on July 16. The Hindus in Kerala observe ‘Karkidakam’, the last month in Malayalam calendar as Ramayana month, chanting the verses from Adhyatma Ramayana, Malayalam translation of Valmiki Ramayana by medieval poet Thunchath Ramanujan Ezhuthachan. Karkidakam month is dedicated for chanting Ramayana, prayers and worship of Lord Rama as the month is considered to be inauspicious for deeds other than the worship of God. All the temples and Hindu households as a whole observe the holy month of Ramayana. This year, Karkidakam spans from July 16 to August 14. The Hindus in the state owe a great debt of gratitude to a Sangh Pracharak who resurrected the tradition of reading Ramayana during Karkkidakam month. RSS Pracharak late P Parameswaran, affectionately called Parameswarji, popularised the Ramayana among the ordinary Hindu families in Kerala. Ramayana Masacharanam or the observance of Ramayana month in Karkkidakam at Hindu temples and homes was a concept mooted by Parameswarji at the Vishala Hindu Sammelanam held in Kochi in the late 1970s. In view of the spread of coronavirus, this year, most of the temples in the state remain closed, and rituals and Ramayana chanting are mainly confined to houses. However, various Hindu organisations and fraternities are conducting a month-long Ramayana chanting and discourses on various digital and social media platforms. ",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/16/Holy-Ramayana-Month-begins-in-Kerala.html

Central Hindi Institute's initiative in preserving Shina Language - the mother of Dardic languages spoken in Gilgit-Baltistan of Ladakh & JK, 25-Jul-2020,- Aayushi Rajpurohit,"Shina, the mother of Dardic languages is primarily spoken in Gilgit-Baltistan, Dah Hanu, Gurais and Dras in India. Researchers suggests that the focus on speakers of indigenous languages is necessary in order to save them from language shift and language loss eventually resulting in loss of culture. With the number of people speaking native languages receding at an alarming pace, languages like Shina are feared to be endangered anytime soon. The population of the areas of Kashmir, Gurez, Kargil and Ladakh have been restive for the last few decades and have been prey to the pursuit of forced assimilation and agenda of Islamisation. Native languages: Stigma than cultural Capital? A plethora of research suggests that a sense of shame can be witnessed in the native people considering their language. It is seen as a marker of being uncivilised and lower class. Meanwhile, English and Urdu make them feel civilised. The attitude towards their own language is observed to be more stigma than cultural capital. Factors like Shina neither being a part of the school curriculum nor spoken by those at the helm of affairs have contributed to this gloomy situation. The agenda of Islamisation pushed by self-serving overseers has cultivated and promoted this mindset that condemns the use of native languages eventually giving birth to this milieu of cultural shame. Linguistic importance can be hardly overlooked. Divergent views on the origin of Shina prevail in the society. While local researchers assert that it came into existence thousands of years ago into the region from down south, raw carvings found all across the region support the claim making it sufficiently inferable that the Shina language has survived and developed over a period of 3000-5000 years. Archaeological evidence in the area makes it plausible that it might be an offshoot of Sanskrit. Interestingly, Shina is known to be a sister language to Sanskrit. Shina, the mother of Dardic languages is primarily spoken in Gilgit-Baltistan, Dah Hanu, Gurais and Dras in India. Dialects of Shina include Gilgiti, Bagroti, Bunji, Drasi, Gurezi, Dareli and Chilasi. Unfortunately, these languages exist only in spoken form without any proper orthography. Popular opinion amongst researchers suggests that the focus on speakers of indigenous languages is necessary in order to save them from language shift and language loss eventually resulting in loss of culture. Initiative of the Central Institute of Hindi Taking note of the prevailing situation, the Central Institute of Hindi has done a commendable job to preserve Shina, the language that has connected Jammu and Kashmir to PoK since time immemorial. Under their ‘Project for development of Dictionaries- Hindi folk dictionary Project’, the Central Institute of Hindi has compiled and published Shina words, meanings and usages in book form. Language experts from Kargil were invited to facilitate and expedite the process. Intending to capture, preserve and incorporate the cultural and linguistic heritage of India, the institute also prepares instructional material for the States of Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Sikkim. A year ago, a compilation of essentials of the Balti language was also published. As a part of its Hindi Folk Dictionary Project, the Central Institute of Hindi has taken up the task of compiling and publishing essentials and dictionaries of 80 languages of which Hindi-Mizo, Hindi-Garo, Hindi- Jaintia, Hindi-Bodo will be a part.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/25/Central-Hindi-Institute-initiative-in-preserving-Shina-Language.html
"Unsung Heroes of Sri Ram Janmabhumi Movement: KK Nair, an ICS officer from Kerala who defied Nehru’s ‘Aurangzebic diktat’", 01-Aug-2020,,"KK Nair aka Kandangalathil Karunakaran Nair is a name deeply engraved in the history of the Ayodhya movement. The brave ICS officer, hailing from the southern state of India, played an unforgettable role in reinstating the fundamental right to worship of Hindus in the Rama Janmabhumi before India became a constitutional republic. Born on September 11, 1907, KK Nair began his life from Kuttanad, a small village in Alappuzha, Kerala. After completing his education in Kerala, he went to England for higher studies and won ICS at the age of 21. He joined as a civil servant in Uttar Pradesh in 1945 and became Deputy Commissioner-cum-District Magistrate of Faizabad on June 1, 1949. As the District Magistrate, Nair entrusted his assistant Guru Datt Singh to file a ground report on the Ayodhya issue, after receiving a letter from the state government on the same. In his report sent to Nair on October 10, 1949, Guru Datt Singh unambiguously recommended the construction of a grand Ram temple at the site. “As per your orders, I went to the spot and inspected the site and enquired all about it in detail. Mosque and the temple both are situated side by side and both Hindus and Muslims perform their rites and religious ceremonies. Hindu public has put in this application with a view to erecting a decent and vishal temple instead of the small one which exists at present. There is nothing on the way and permission can be given as Hindu population is very keen to have a nice temple at the place where Bhagwan Ram Chandra Ji was born. The land where temple is to be erected is of Nazul [government land],” says Singh’s report to Nair. On December 22, 1949, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Govind Vallabh Pant, at the behest of the then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, ordered to expel the Hindus from the temple of Ram Lalla. But Faizabad District Collector KK Nair refused to implement the order, pointing out that the real stakeholders were performing Pooja there and the move would lead to riots and bloodshed. Following the incident, Govind Vallabh Pant suspended KK Nair from the service. But Nair fought the Congress Government at court and managed to get an order in his favour. After rejoining the service, he decided not to continue as an IAS officer as, by the time, he became an eyesore to Nehru. After resigning from the service, he started practising as a lawyer in the Allahabad High Court. By challenging the ‘Aurangzebic diktat’ of Nehru against Hindus, KK Nair upheld justice and made the way to the hearts of millions of people. People in and around Faizabad fondly called him ‘Nair Saheb’. Taking the fight for Ram Mandir forward, KK Nair and his family joined the Jana Sangh. In 1952, his wife Sakunatala Nair contested on the Jana Sangh ticket and became a member of Uttar Pradesh assembly. Later, in 1962, both KK Nair and his wife became members of the 4th Lok Sabha, winning Bahraich and Kaiserganj constituencies respectively. Interestingly, their driver was also elected as a member of the UP legislative assembly from Faizabad assembly constituency. The couple was later arrested and jailed during the Emergency for protesting against the fascist regime of Indira Gandhi. Shri Nair remained as a Jana Sangh worker till his death, September 7, 1977. Though he was a venerable and much-celebrated figure in Uttar Pradesh in those days, he did not receive due recognition in Kerala. Now a group of nationalists in the state is building a memorial in his home village, under the aegis of KK Nair memorial charitable trust. The memorial is being built on the land donated by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. Along with other welfare activities, the trust is aimed at offering training for civil service aspirants and scholarships for eligible students.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/1/Unsung-Heroes-of-Ram-Janmabhumi-Movement-KK-Nair.html
"#MyBharat Bharat’s Jnana Parampara is based on Evolution, not Revolution: Shri J Nandakumar", 12-Aug-2020,VSK Karnataka,"On Day 11, Sri J Nandakumar, National Convenor of the Prajna Pravah spoke about Bharath Bodh – Idea of Bharat at Disha Bharat organised 15 day lecture series on the occassion on 74th Indian Independence Day. Addressing the viewers in a Facebook live, Shri Nandakumar said that Bharatiyas should be proud that of our Jnana Parampara (Knowledge Tradition) was based on Evolution (Utkranti) and not mere Revolution (Kranti). The knowledge through which Bharat is leading the world is outlined on the huge repository of the spiritual knowledge our ancestors have bestowed upon us he said. The supreme and vast concept of Dharma which is binding us altogether is the ingredient, the world can pick from us, as Bharat never concealed the knowledge to be confined to us alone. The thought of sharing of knowledge was laid out towards Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam meaning the world as a whole is a family and not restricting to the smallest family unit. He reminded the audience of the eminent thinker Sri Ranga Hari who had elucidated Dharma as those broken pieces of magnet which get realigned and its obvious nature was to stay united. Speaking about the tradition of communication in Bharat, often called samvada, was multifaceted and it should be devoid of prejudice(purvagraha) and stubbornness to accept(duragraha) he said. The samvada is not between humans or animals but with nature as a whole. While the west preached the thoery of being binary in nature to bring about uniformity, Sanatana Dharma was towards unity. The hostility in the nature of the western people towards others is always driven by warring forces, which was never seen in Bharat. The Sanathana Dharma through its philosophy taught interdependence(samanvaya) which always led to success. The profound thoughts of Hindutva guided Manava, Nara, Janata (Human being) to transcend towards Madhava, Narayana, Janardhana(Godliness) for mukti he said. While there were multiple facets to identify the unifying factors in Bharat through music, culture, arts, festivals, traditions there were imminent threats we needed to be worried about he opined. The grand idea of Bharat was always being suppressed by religious expansionst, imperial, colonial forces which have time and again attacked Bharat he said. Dharampal had listed as two universes around- one being the rural-based Bharat which was more serene while its urbanized counterpart was being development focused and detrimental towards sustained cultural unity. Sri Nandakumar felt unhappy about the education policy all the while in Bharat of teaching in English medium and welcomed the National Education Policy’s proposal of imparting students in the formative years through the mother tongue or regional language. He also expressed his pain on the true history of Bharat, the contributions of Bharat towards science were ignored, but with NEP, the European centric education was slowing turning towards Bharat centric hopeful of removing the historic distortions too. Nandakumar questioned the intellectuals and eminent historians who denigrated Savarkar a pioneer who termed the 1857 war as First war of Indian Independence. The acceptance of RC Majumdar also among historians was low, for his strong views on Islamic fundamentalism he said. When such nonacceptance piled up automatically Kalidasa got termed as Indian Shakespeare, or Kautilya as Indian Machiavelli while the the profoundness in the formers were incomparable to the latters historically and chronologically. Accepting knowledge from all over the world is welcome but indigenous time tested arts in agriculture, science are mocked at. Inferiority, Ignorance, Ill-will towards Bharat, Irreverance towards Bharat, Incompetence, Inertia  are the ill effects of such colonial minds. Divisive forces who derive sadistic pleasure by creating chaos preach borrowed western thoughts which are defective in theory and destructive in practice he warned the audience to be careful of.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/12/Bharat-s-Jnana-Parampara-is-based-on-Evolution-not-Revolution-Shri-J-Nandakumar.html

"Kerala Simham Veera Pazhassi Raja: The Indian king who brought the British Army to its knees and defeated Arthur Wellesley, the vanquisher of Napoleon in Waterloo!", 15-Aug-2020,Sabareesh P A,"Bharat is home to the lineage of countless warriors who defended the country against Arab, Portuguese, British, Dutch, French and other colonial forces both on land and sea over the last 1000 years. When the British East India Company traders played the strategy to rule India it swiftly took the shape of British political hegemonism with a militaristic fervour. Much before the First War of Indian Independence in 1857 the forces of the British East India Company confusingly paused at a fierce warrior king in Kerala whose name reverberated as Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja - केरलवर्मापलशीराजा.  Also known as ‘Kerala Simham’ or the lion of Kerala, Pazhassi Raja presented crushing defeats to the British forces and equally resisted the invading forces of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan of Mysore. The statue of Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja inside the Pazhassi Raja SmrithiMandiram at Pazhassi in Mattannur, Kerala. Kerala Varma (birth name) was born in 1753 at Pazhassi / पलशीin Kannur into the royal family of Kottayam.This resilient prince was put to test when he was made one of the de facto heads of state at the age of 21 by superseding many older contenders. This was the critical time when forces of Hyder Ali had seized the kingdom of Malabar in 1773 which led the then King of Kottayam to seek political asylum with the kingdom of Travancore. Pazhassi Raja resisted the troops of Hyder Ali in 1774 and ultimately led his kingdom to victory against the forces of Hyder Ali in 1793 through a deliberate and intended alliance with the British. But the British had different ideas, including securing a monopoly over the pepper trade point near the Thalassery port which was liberated from Hyder Ali! The British started levying the tax and struck a deal with Kerala Varma’s uncle Vira Varma and appointed him as the King of Kottayam. What followed was the British’s cunning and treacherous double game of tax centred exploitation of the peasantry and yet maintaining the sovereignty of Vira Varma as the local ruler.  This interference by the British in the local governance and affairs of the economy which exploited the common people was the reason that made Kerala Varma the legend he is known for: Kerala Simham. Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja’s resistance against the British was unique in the sense that he refused to abandon his subjects and was immensely successful in mobilizing people of all castes, classes and faiths. He earned immense respect from the people for his firm decisions, resilience and successful war tactics. However, this popular support angered the British and the Pazhassi’s palace was attacked and royal treasuries plundered in 1796. Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja and his men escaped into the forests of Wayanad. He started to build an army to wage guerilla warfare and established strategic camps which was positioned across the thick forests of Wayanad. The British with no knowledge of the deep forests could not even reach Pazhassi Raja.  In 1797 Pazhassi Raja’s forces defeated an army of over a thousand troops led by Major Cameron where only a few of the British soldiers returned alive. Such conflicts continued the next four years until the British came up with their peace treaty with Pazhassi Raja. However, with the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799 and British annexation of Mysore, the tensions between Pazhassi Raja and the British resurfaced when the British attempted to annexe Wayanad into Mysore. However this time Pazhassi Raja presented the British with a blowing defeat that deemed eligible for global recognition till date. Pazhassi Raja waged the 13 year long Cotiotewar (1793 – 1806) or the war of Kottayam against the British. The guerilla warfare tactics of Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja thwarted and defeated the British forces led by the globally acclaimed Maj. General Arthur Wellesley - the Duke of Wellington, who had lateron led the British forces to victory at the second Anglo-Maratha War (1803), at the Battle of Waterloo (1815)against Napoleon Bonaparte and later became the British Prime Minister twice. Therefore Cotiote war waged by Pazhassi Raja is the only war in which the globally acclaimed Major General Arthur Wellesley failed and that too against a fiery local king. The Cotiote war of 13 years also happens to be the longest war fought by the English East India Company during their conquests in India and was much longer than the Anglo-Mysore wars, Anglo-Maratha wars, Anglo-Sikh wars and Polygar wars! Pazhassi Raja inducted the Kurichya tribes of Wayanad into his guerilla warfare in the Cotiote war and amazingly proved the dominating strength of the arrows against that of the British guns. The Cotiote war also caused severe loss of lives in the ranks of British officers and soldiers. The British were nowhere near in even tracing Pazhassi Raja in the forests of Wayanad. The British therefore resorted to recruiting Kolkars who were the natives and had detailed knowledge of the forests of Wayanad so as to secure information that could enable the British forces in capturing Pazhassi Raja. It was through treachery and information leaked out by the native Kolkars that the British succeeded in trapping Pazhassi Raja on 1805. Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja attained martyrdom fighting the British forces at the age of 52 in 1805, thus bringing an end to his resistance which started in 1774. Pazhassi Raja’svalour, daring courage, indomitable spirit and the unrelenting love for his people is unforgettable for the generations who have known his life. Indeed, the revolt and resistance of Pazhassi Raja was a people’s revolt as he united people from all walks of life. The ‘Pazhassi Raja Tomb Museum’in Manathavady, Wayanad still hosts the king’s memorabilia and weaponry used by the king and his troops. Pazhassi Raja’s 32 years of resistance against the British tyranny is artistically documented in the well-acclaimed 2009 Malayalam movie ‘Pazhassi Raja’. The martyrdom of Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja is but the eternal saga of struggle and brave resistance for Indian Independence.

The Idea of Akhand Bharat: Concept and Meaning, 15-Aug-2020,,"The idea of Akhand Bharat is as old as a civilisation as it duly got a place and described in ancient Bharatiya scriptures. The idea of Akhand Bharat was originated by the master of the Arthashastra, Chanakya. At the time, the 3rd century BC, the Indian subcontinent–which covered what are now the modern-day nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Burma, Tibet, Bhutan, and Bangladesh – was divided into many independent kingdoms. Chanakya articulated the idea of an Akhand Bharat, which means all states in the region being under one authority, rule, and administration. The great freedom fighter, revolutionary and Hindu Mahasabha leader Swatantrya Veer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, propounded the notion of an Akhand Bharat as well as a Hindu Rashtra (Hindu Nation), emphasizing the potential cultural, religious and political unity of Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains throughout the Indian subcontinent ‘from Kashmir to Rameshwaram and from Sindh to Assam’. At the time of the Indian Independence Movement, Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi advocated for Akhand Hindustan, a proposition that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, agreed with. On 7–8 October 1944, in Delhi, Radha Kumud Mukherjee, a leading intellectual, presided over the Akhand Hindustan Leaders’ Conference. RSS pracharak and Bharatiya Jansangh leader Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay further defined the idea of Akhand Bharat. He said, “The word 'Akhand Bharat' (un-divided India) includes all those basic values of nationalism and an integral culture.” “These words include the feeling that this entire land from Attock to Cuttack, Kutch to Kamrup, and Kashmir to Kanya Kumari is not only sacred to us but is a part of us. The people who have been born in it since times immemorial and who still live in it may have all the differences superficially brought about by place and time, but the basic unity of their entire life can be seen in every devotee of Akhand Bharat.” M S Golwalkar, the second Sarsanghchalak of RSS, at a press conference in Delhi on August 24, 1949, termed Pakistan as an “uncertain state” and stated “If the partition is a settled fact, we are here to unsettle it. There is, in fact, no such thing as a ‘settled fact’ in this world. Things get settled or unsettled solely by the will of man. And man’s will be steeled by a spirit of dedication to a cause, which he knows to be righteous and glorious.” Source: News Bharati",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/15/The-Idea-of-Akhand-Bharat.html
Ayodhya’s tryst with destiny, 11-Aug-2020,,"Ganesh Puthur Bharat’s 500-year-old civilisational struggle for reclaiming Ram Janmabhumi ended with Prime Minister Narendra Modi performing Bhoomi pujan for the construction of Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on August 5th. Though the beginning of temple construction has lead to meltdown among Islamists and Communists, the nation has welcomed the Bhoomi pujan by lighting ‘diyas’ and distributing sweets. While addressing the spiritual gurus post the ceremony, PM Modi recapitulated the idea of ‘Rama Rajya’ popularised by Mahatma Gandhi. He also commemorated the sacrifices made by devotees spanning 5 centuries and asked the nation to draw inspiration from the Ram Temple which will again come at the exact spot where it was demolished by invaders. Much has been said and written about the history of Ayodhya and the disputed structure which stood over the Ram Janmastan until 1992, the year on which it was finally razed down by the Hindus. During medieval times, Islamic invaders often destroyed or converted temples to Masjids. There are enough archaeological and written records to substantiate that thousands of Hindu temples had been demolished with idols dismantled, ranging from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Ayodhya is just once among the most revered temples snatched from Hindus by the Islamic tyrants. In 2003, excavations were carried out by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in Ram Janmabhumi. Remains of a large temple complex dedicated to Lord Ram were found which confirmed the existence of a temple before being demolished by Mir Baqi in 1528 following Babur’s order. In its 2010 verdict, the Allahabad high court too upheld the ASI findings. As written by eminent archaeologist K K Mohammed in his autobiography, it was the lobby of Marxist historians who peddled fake allegations claiming that the discovered remains were planted by ASI due to political compulsions. Historians in the initial stage were reluctant to accept that the disputed structure was build after demolishing a Hindu temple. Later they accepted demolition of the grand temple but continued to oppose the construction of Ram Mandir at the exact spot. Academicians and Historians allied with the ‘Quam-Red’ faction have clubbed demolition of the disputed structure in 1992 with ‘Hindu Fascism’ and ‘cultural nationalism’. But they always chose not to condemn fanatic invaders for the destruction and looting of Hindu temples. In the last minute to the run-up of Bhoomi pujan, Congress Party’s sudden love for Lord Ram caught everyone by surprise. The same Congress Party had dissociated themselves from the construction of Somnath Temple in Gujarat with Pandit Nehru (who chose to be a European in his world view) writing off the construction as mere ‘Hindu revivalism’. The same party in 2007 told the Supreme Court that there was no proof for the existence of Lord Ram. Now their senior leaders are standing in queue for donating money to Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust which monitors the construction of Ram Mandir. But unfortunately for the grand old party their ally in Kerala- Muslim League launched a strong protest to the party’s high command for a statement made by Party’s General Secretary and UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi. Interestingly the same Muslim League had welcomed the decision of Turkey’s Supreme Court to convent Hagia Sophia (originally a cathedral made by Justinian I) to Mosque. It will be interesting to see whether the Congress dump their prospectus in the entire nation for just two or three Lok Sabha seats that the Muslim League can bring in. The narrative of Muslim victimisation in India has been woven around the Karseva of 1992. In these days, much propaganda works were seen on the Editorial pages of leading national dailies. To further expose their hypocrisy, editorials also contained articles which lamented for the people of Jammu and Kashmir since August 5th also marked the anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370. No newspapers left space for the story of Kashmiri Hindus who were thrown out of Kashmir long before the demolition of the disputed structure. Coming back to Ayodhya, the temple town is all set to take a makeover. Ayodhya had been ignored by successive state governments and had been left with trembling infrastructure. The present dispensations (both at the State and Central levels) have initiated multiple projects that will eventually develop the city to accommodate millions of people who will flock to Ayodhya after the construction of Bhavya Ram Mandir. As mentioned by PM Modi, there are multiple Ramayanas indigenous to almost all nations in south and south-east Asia. But there is only one Ram and one Ayodhya. Hence, Ayodhya is ‘Punyabhumi’ to every Indian who inherits the goodliness of Lord Ram. What we see in Ayodhya is the resurgence of the soul of Bharat, rising up from the shambles of past and finally overcoming all the attempts of the invaders spanning centuries to destroy our culture and legacy.

"“The Sanatan Dharma, that is nationalism. This is the message that I have to speak to you!”: Here's how Sri Aurobindo defined Hindutva in his historic Uttarpara Speech (Full Text)", 16-Aug-2020,,"""I say no longer that nationalism is a creed, a religion, a faith; I say that it is the Sanatan Dharma which for us is nationalism. This Hindu nation was born with the Sanatan Dharma, with it, it moves and with it, it grows."" Sri Aurobindo delivered the speech in a warm reception organised for him after his acquittal in the Alipore Bomb Case. The famous Uttarpara speech laid the ideological foundation for Hindutva, the Hindu nationalism, in which Maharshi Aurobindo emphatically said, ""I say no longer that nationalism is a creed, a religion, a faith; I say that it is the Sanatan Dharma which for us is nationalism. This Hindu nation was born with the Sanatan Dharma, with it, it moves and with it, it grows."" Laying out his vision for a new Bharat which is essentially rooted in cultural, political and spiritual idea of the nation, Sri Aurobindo narrated what he was commanded to do: ""He (Vasudeva) said to me, ""This is the young generation, the new and mighty nation that is arising at my command. They are greater than yourself. What have you to fear? If you stood aside or slept, the work would still be done. If you were cast aside tomorrow, here are the young men who will take up your work and do it more mightily than you have ever done. You have only got some strength from me to speak a word to this nation which will help to raise it."" Sri Aurobindo’s Uttarpara Speech has been defined by his biographer A.B. Purani as “a public document of Sri Aurobindo’s spiritual life and contains in seed form some of the basic principles of the yoga he evolved. The human in him yet spoke of the Divine and then the human was completely transformed into the Divine. The Light that he shed was the Light Divine and it is for humanity to follow it and profit by it.” (The Life of Sri Aurobindo, p. 123) Full Text of Uttarpara Speech delivered by Maharshi Aurobindo on May 30, 1909 ""When I was asked to speak to you at the annual meeting of your Sabha, it was my intention to say a few words about the subject chosen for today, the subject of the Hindu religion. I do not know now whether I shall fulfill that intention; for as I sat here, there came into my mind a word that I have to speak to you, a word that I have to speak to the whole of the Indian Nation. It was spoken first to myself in jail and I have come out of jail to speak it to my people. It was more than a year ago that I came here last. When I came I was not alone; one of the mightiest prophets of Nationalism sat by my side. It was he who then came out of the seclusion to which God had sent him, so that in the silence and solitude of his cell he might hear the word that He had to say. It was he that you came in your hundreds to welcome. Now he is far away, separated from us by thousands of miles. Others whom I was accustomed to find working beside me are absent. The storm that swept over the country has scattered them far and wide. It is I this time who have spent one year in seclusion, and now that I come out I find all changed. One who always sat by my side and was associated in my work is a prisoner in Burma; another is in the north rotting in detention. I looked round when I came out, I looked round for those to whom I had been accustomed to look for counsel and inspiration. I did not find them. There was more than that. When I went to jail the whole country was alive with the cry of Bande Mataram, alive with the hope of a nation, the hope of millions of men who had newly risen out of degradation. When I came out of jail I listened for that cry, but there was instead a silence. A hush had fallen on the country and men seemed bewildered; for instead of God's bright heaven full of the vision of the future that had been before us, there seemed to be overhead a leaden sky from which human thunders and lightning rained. No man seemed to know which way to move, and from all sides came the question, ""What shall we do next ? What is there that we can do ?"" I too did not know which way to move, I too did not know what was next to be done. But one thing I knew, that as it was the Almighty Power of God which had raised that cry, that hope, so it was the same Power which had sent down that silence. He who was in the shouting and the movement was also in the pause and the hush. He has sent it upon us, so that the nation might draw back for a moment and look into itself and know His will. I have not been disheartened by that silence because I had been made familiar with silence in my prison and because I knew it was in the pause and the hush that I had myself learned this lesson through the long year of my detention. When Bepin Chandra Pal came out of jail, he came with a message, and it was an inspired message. I remember the speech he made here. It was a speech not so much political as religious in its bearing and intention. He spoke of his realisation in jail, of God within us all, of the Lord within the nation, and in his subsequent speeches also he spoke of a greater than ordinary force in the movement and a greater than ordinary purpose before it. Now I also meet you again, I also come out of jail, and again it is you of Uttarpara who are the first to welcome me, not at a political meeting but at a meeting of a society for the protection of our religion. That message which Bepin Chandra Pal received in Buxar jail, God gave to me in Alipore. That knowledge He gave to me day after day during my twelve months of imprisonment and it is that which He has commanded me to speak to you now that I have come out. I knew I would come out. The year of detention was meant only for a year of seclusion and of training. How could anyone hold me in jail longer than was necessary for God's purpose? He had given me a word to speak and a work to do, and until that word was spoken I knew that no human power could hush me, until that work was done no human power could stop God's instrument, however weak that instrument might be or however small. Now that I have come out, even in these few minutes, a word has been suggested to me which I had no wish to speak. The thing I had in my mind He has thrown from it and what I speak is under an impulse and a compulsion. When I was arrested and hurried to the Lal Bazar hajat I was shaken in faith for a while, for I could not look into the heart of His intention. Therefore I faltered for a moment and cried out in my heart to Him, ""What is this that has happened to me ? I believed that I had a mission to work for the people of my country and until that work was done, I should have Thy protection. Why then am I here and on such a charge ?"" A day passed and a second day and a third, when a voice came to me from within, ""Wait and see."" Then I grew calm and waited, I was taken from Lal Bazar to Alipore and was placed for one month in a solitary cell apart from men. There I waited day and night for the voice of God within me, to know what He had to say to me, to learn what I had to do. In this seclusion the earliest realisation, the first lesson came to me. I remembered then that a month or more before my arrest, a call had come to me to put aside all activity, to go in seclusion and to look into myself, so that I might enter into closer communion with Him. I was weak and could not accept the call. My work was very dear to me and in the pride of my heart I thought that unless I was there, it would suffer or even fail and cease; therefore I would not leave it. It seemed to me that He spoke to me again and said, ""The bonds you had not the strength to break, I have broken for you, because it is not my will nor was it ever my intention that that should continue. I have had another thing for you to do and it is for that I have brought you here, to teach you what you could not learn for yourself and to train you for my work."" Then He placed the Gita in my hands. His strength entered into me and I was able to do the sadhana of the Gita. I was not only to understand intellectually but to realise what Sri Krishna demanded of Arjuna and what He demands of those who aspire to do His work, to be free from repulsion and desire, to do work for Him without the demand for fruit, to renounce self-will and become a passive and faithful instrument in His hands, to have an equal heart for high and low, friend and opponent, success and failure, yet not to do His work negligently. I realised what the Hindu religion meant. We speak often of the Hindu religion, of the Sanatan Dharma, but few of us really know what that religion is. Other religions are preponderatingly religions of faith and profession, but the Sanatan Dharma is life itself; it is a thing that has not so much to be believed as lived. This is the Dharma that for the salvation of humanity was cherished in the seclusion of this peninsula from of old. It is to give this religion that India is rising. She does not rise as other countries do, for self or when she is strong, to trample on the weak. She is rising to shed the eternal light entrusted to her over the world. India has always existed for humanity and not for herself and it is for humanity and not for herself that she must be great. Therefore this was the next thing He pointed out to me. He made me realise the central truth of the Hindu religion. He turned the hearts of my jailors to me and they spoke to the Englishman in charge of the jail, ""He is suffering in his confinement; let him at least walk outside his cell for half an hour in the morning and in the evening."" So it was arranged, and it was while I was walking that His strength again entered into me. I looked the jail that secluded me from men and it was no longer by its high walls that I was imprisoned; no, it was Vasudeva who surrounded me. I walked under the branches of the tree in front of my cell but it was not the tree, I knew it was Vasudeva, it was Sri Krishna whom I saw standing there and holding over me his shade. I looked at the bars of my cell, the very grating that did duty for a door and again I saw Vasudeva. It was Narayana who was guarding and standing sentry over me. Or I lay on the coarse blankets that were given me for a couch and felt the arms of Sri Krishna around me, the arms of my Friend and Lover. This was the first use of the deeper vision He gave me. I looked at the prisoners in the jail, the thieves, the murderers, the swindlers, and as I looked at them I saw Vasudeva, it was Narayana whom I found in these darkened souls and misused bodies. Amongst these thieves and dacoits there were many who put me to shame by their sympathy, their kindness, the humanity triumphant over such adverse circumstances. One I saw among them especially, who seemed to me a saint, a peasant of my nation who did not know how to read and write, an alleged dacoit sentenced to ten years' rigorous imprisonment, one of those whom we look down upon in our Pharisaical pride of class as Chhotalok. Once more He spoke to me and said, ""Behold the people among whom I have sent you to do a little of my work. This is the nature of the nation I am raising up and the reason why I raise them."" When the case opened in the lower court and we were brought before the Magistrate I was followed by the same insight. He said to me, ""When you were cast into jail, did not your heart fail and did you not cry out to me, where is Thy protection ? Look now at the Magistrate, look now at the Prosecuting Counsel."" I looked and it was not the Magistrate whom I saw, it was Vasudeva, it was Narayana who was sitting there on the bench. I looked at the Prosecuting Counsel and it was not the Counsel for the prosecution that I saw; it was Sri Krishna who sat there, it was my Lover and Friend who sat there and smiled. ""Now do you fear ?"" He said, ""I am in all men and I overrule their actions and their words. My protection is still with you and you shall not fear. This case which is brought against you, leave it in my hand. It is not for you. It was not for the trial that I brought you here but for something else. The case itself is only a means for my work and nothing more."" Afterwards when the trial opened in the Sessions Court, I began to write many instructions for my Counsel as to what was false in the evidence against me and on what points the witnesses might be cross-examined. Then something happened which I had not expected. The arrangements which had been made for my defence were suddenly changed and another Counsel stood there to defend me. He came unexpectedly, a friend of mine, but I did not know he was coming. You have all heard the name of the man who put away from him all other thoughts and abandoned all his practice, who sat up half the night day after day for months and broke his health to save me, Srijut Chittaranjan Das. When I saw him, I was satisfied, but I still thought it necessary to write instructions. Then all that was put away from me and I had the message from within, ""This is the man who will save you from the snares put around your feet. Put aside those papers. It is not you who will instruct him. I will instruct him."" From that time I did not of myself speak a word to my Counsel about the case or give a single instruction, and if ever I was asked a question, I always found that my answer did not help the case. I had left it to him and he took it entirely into his hands, with what result you know. I knew all along what He meant for me, for I heard it again and again, always I listened to the voice within; ""I am guiding, therefore fear not. Turn to your own work for which I have brought you to jail and when you come out, remember never to fear, never to hesitate. Remember that it is I who am doing this, not you nor any other. Therefore whatever clouds may come, whatever dangers and sufferings, whatever difficulties, whatever impossibilities, there is nothing impossible, nothing difficult. I am in the nation and its uprising and I am Vasudeva, I am Narayana, and what I will, shall be, not what others will. What I choose to bring about, no human power can stay."" Meanwhile He had brought me out of solitude and placed me among those who had been accused along with me. You have spoken much today of my self-sacrifice and devotion to my country. I have heard that kind of speech ever since I came out of jail, but I hear it with embarrassment, with something of pain. For I know my weakness, I am a prey to my own faults and backslidings. I was not blind to them before and when they all rose up against me in seclusion, I felt them utterly. I knew them that I the man was a man of weakness, a faulty and imperfect instrument, strong only when a higher strength entered into me. Then I found myself among these young men and in many of them I discovered a mighty courage, a power of self-effacement in comparison with which I was simply nothing. I saw one or two who were not only superior to me in force and character, - very many were that, - but in the promise of that intellectual ability on which I prided myself. He said to me, ""This is the young generation, the new and mighty nation that is arising at my command. They are greater than yourself. What have you to fear ? If you stood aside or slept, the work would still be done. If you were cast aside tomorrow, here are the young men who will take up your work and do it more mightily than you have ever done. You have only got some strength from me to speak a word to this nation which will help to raise it."" This was the next thing He told me. Then a thing happened suddenly and in a moment I was hurried away to the seclusion of a solitary cell. What happened to me during that period I am not impelled to say, but only that day after day, He showed me His wonders and made me realise the utter truth of the Hindu religion. I had many doubts before. I was brought up in England amongst foreign ideas and an atmosphere entirely foreign. About many things in Hinduism I had once been inclined to believe that they were imaginations, that there was much of dream in it, much that was delusion and Maya. But now day after day I realised in the mind, I realised in the heart, I realised in the body the truths of the Hindu religion. They became living experiences to me, and things were opened to me which no material science could explain. When I first approached Him, it was not entirely in the spirit of the Jnani. I came to Him long ago in Baroda some years before the Swadeshi began and I was drawn into the public field. When I approached God at that time, I hardly had a living faith in Him. The agnostic was in me, the atheist was in me, the sceptic was in me and I was not absolutely sure that there was a God at all. I did not feel His presence. Yet something drew me to the truth of the Vedas, the truth of the Gita, the truth of the Hindu religion. I felt there must be a mighty truth somewhere in this Yoga, a mighty truth in this religion based on the Vedanta. So when I turned to the Yoga and resolved to practise it and find out if my idea was right, I did it in this spirit and with this prayer to Him, ""If Thou art, then Thou knowest my heart. Thou knowest that I do not ask for Mukti, I do not ask for anything which others ask for. I ask only for strength to uplift this nation, I ask only to be allowed to live and work for this people whom I love and to whom I pray that I may devote my life."" I strove long for the realisation of Yoga and at last to some extent I had it, but in what I most desired I was not satisfied. Then in the seclusion of the jail, of the solitary cell I asked for it again. I said, ""Give me Thy Adesh. I do not know what work to do or how to do it. Give me a message."" In the communion of Yoga two messages came. The first message said, ""I have given you a work and it is to help to uplift this nation. Before long the time will come when you will have to go out of jail; for it is not my will that this time either you should be convicted or that you should pass the time, as others have to do, in suffering for their country. I have called you to work, and that is the Adesh for which you have asked. I give you the Adesh to go forth and do my work."" The second message came and it said, ""Something has been shown to you in this year of seclusion, something about which you had your doubts and it is the truth of the Hindu religion. It is this religion that I am raising up before the world, it is this that I have perfected and developed through the Rishis, saints and Avatars, and now it is going forth to do my work among the nations. I am raising up this nation to send forth my word. This is the Sanatan Dharma, this is the eternal religion which you did not really know before, but which I have now revealed to you. The agnostic and the sceptic in you have been answered, for I have given you proofs within and without you, physical and subjective, which have satisfied you. When you go forth, speak to your nation always this word, that it is for the Sanatan Dharma that they arise, it is for the world and not for themselves that they arise. I am giving them freedom for the service of the world. When therefore it is said that India shall rise, it is the Sanatan Dharma that shall be great. When it is said that India shall expand and extend herself, it is the Sanatan Dharma that shall expand and extend itself over the world. It is for the Dharma and by the Dharma that India exists. To magnify the religion means to magnify the country. I have shown you that I am everywhere and in all men and in all things, that I am in this movement and I am not only working in those who are striving for the country but I am working also in those who oppose them and stand in their path. I am working in everybody and whatever men may think or do, they can do nothing but help in my purpose. They also are doing my work, they are not my enemies but my instruments. In all your actions you are moving forward without knowing which way you move. You mean to do one thing and you do another. You aim at a result and your efforts subserve one that is different or contrary. It is Shakti that has gone forth and entered into the people. Since long ago I have been preparing this uprising and now the time has come and it is I who will lead it to its fulfilment."" This then is what I have to say to you. The name of your society is ""Society for the Protection of Religion"". Well, the protection of the religion, the protection and upraising before the world of the Hindu religion, that is the work before us. But what is the Hindu religion ? What is this religion which we call Sanatan, eternal ? It is the Hindu religion only because the Hindu nation has kept it, because in this Peninsula it grew up in the seclusion of the sea and the Himalayas, because in this sacred and ancient land it was given as a charge to the Aryan race to preserve through the ages. But it is not circumscribed by the confines of a single country, it does not belong peculiarly and for ever to a bounded part of the world. That which we call the Hindu religion is really the eternal religion, because it is the universal religion which embraces all others. If a religion is not universal, it cannot be eternal. A narrow religion, a sectarian religion, an exclusive religion can live only for a limited time and a limited purpose. This is the one religion that can triumph over materialism by including and anticipating the discoveries of science and the speculations of philosophy. It is the one religion which impresses on mankind the closeness of God to us and embraces in its compass all the possible means by which man can approach God. It is the one religion which insists every moment on the truth which all religions acknowledge that He is in all men and all things and that in Him we move and have our being. It is the one religion which enables us not only to understand and believe this truth but to realise it with every part of our being. It is the one religion which shows the world what the world is, that it is the Lila of Vasudeva. It is the one religion which shows us how we can best play our part in that Lila, its subtlest laws and its noblest rules. It is the one religion which does not separate life in any smallest detail from religion, which knows what immortality is and has utterly removed from us the reality of death. This is the word that has been put into my mouth to speak to you today. What I intended to speak has been put away from me, and beyond what is given to me I have nothing to say. It is only the word that is put into me that I can speak to you. That word is now finished. I spoke once before with this force in me and I said then that this movement is not a political movement and that nationalism is not politics but a religion, a creed, a faith. I say it again today, but I put it in another way. I say no longer that nationalism is a creed, a religion, a faith; I say that it is the Sanatan Dharma which for us is nationalism. This Hindu nation was born with the Sanatan Dharma, with it it moves and with it it grows. When the Sanatan Dharma declines, then the nation declines, and if the Sanatan Dharma were capable of perishing, with the Sanatan Dharma it would perish. The Sanatan Dharma, that is nationalism. This is the message that I have to speak to you.""",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/16/Sri-Aurobindo-and-Uttarpara-Speech.html
"Movie based on ‘true history’ of 1921 Malabar Hindu genocide: Director Ali Akbar raises over Rs 76 lakhs through crowdfunding, launches film production house 'Mama Dharma'", 19-Aug-2020,,"Malayalam film director Ali Akbar has raised over Rs 76 lakhs through crowdfunding and launched a film production company named ‘Mama Dharma’. The new film production company was inaugurated by Swami Chidanandapuri Maharaj, the head of Kolathur Advaita Ashram. The new production house was launched with the sole aim of producing a film based on the true history of the Malabar Hindu Genocide in 1921. The pre-production works of the film are in the initial stages, he said. Ali Akbar said that the film will be released next year. Ali Akbar has come up with his new film in response to the Communist-Jihadi nexus’ announcement of films on the life of Variyan Kunnathu Kunjahammed Haji, a Jihadi who perpetrated the 1921 anti-Hindu genocide. On the eve of the 100th anniversary of the Khilafat movement, three Malayalam movies in praise of the Moplah genocide of Hindus, had been announced in Kerala. The Islamist-controlled Malayalam film industry went on a Khilafat movie spree after the announcement of a film, based on the life of the notorious Hindu massacre Variyan Kunnathu Kunjahammed, by director Ashiq Abu. The move has triggered widespread anger and condemnation across the state as Kunjahammed was the chief of the jihadi force that led the anti-Hindu riots in Malabar during Khilafat movement in which thousands of Hindus were butchered, raped and forcibly converted to Islam. Swami Chidanandapuri extended his full support to the new venture that seeks to bring out the hitherto suppressed history of the Hindu genocide. Kesari Editor-in-Chief NR Madhu and Janmabhumi News Editor M Balakrishnan were among those presented on the occasion. Soliciting support for his new film, Ali Akbar, in a Facebook post, said, ""The Hindu genocide, the mass Islamic conversions that terrorised Kerala in 1921, following the Malabar Maappila Lahala and its associated Khilafat Movement remains the darkest episode of Islamic brutality on Hindus, unparalleled in the History of Bharat.""",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/19/Movie-based-on-true-history-of-1921-Malabar-Hindu-genocide.html

IMTECH takes up sample testing for Covid-19, 04-Apr-2020,Jyoti Singh,"Covid-19 has posed several challenges to the healthcare sector. The limited number of test kits for Covid-19 is one such challenge. As of now, India has been primarily testing patients with a travel history. However, the rate of testing should improve in terms of testing per million population. To boost its testing capacity, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR-IMTECH) hasstepped up to take up Covid-19 sample testing.This is in line with the directives issued by the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) to the Government of India and the advisory issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to operationalise Covid-19 testing by laboratories underCSIR and other labs affiliated to Department of Science and Technology (DST), Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Department of Atomic Energy (DAE). “Theinitiative of ICMR to involve all government-accredited labs is a welcome step and will be a game changer in testing of Covid-19 samples. This would increase the testing rate among suspected patients. In the initial phase, IMTECH plans to operationalise capabilities to carry out testing of 50 to 100 samples a day, which can be subsequently ramped up as and when required,” said DrSanjeev Khosla, Director, IMTECH, Chandigarh. The institution has augmented its capabilities to carry out clinical testing for COVID-19 and has the necessary expertise in molecular microbiology. The lab has the requisite infrastructure including Biosafety Level (BSL)-3 facility as the labs are advised to take all appropriate biosafety and bio-security precautions before testing. A newly constructed BSL-2+ virology lab equipped with Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) equipment has also been established. All the mandatory approvals required for testing of clinical samples have been obtained to operationalise testing at the earliest. Apart from testing of clinical samples, CSIR-IMTECH is also supporting healthcare professionals by providing Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) to prevent them from contracting any infection while serving patients. The institute is also extending help to the local administration and Red Cross Unit of Chandigarh by providing the logistical and infrastructure support.

IIT Kanpur researchers to design a cost-effective virucidal coating of surgical masks for preventive measures against COVID-19, 04-Apr-2020,,"Scheme of virucidal coating of surgical masks for resisting attachment of virions  Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), a statutory body under Department of Science and Technology, is supporting a research by a team of scientists from IIT Kanpur for developing a protective coating that would greatly help in making medicated masks and medical wear (PPE) for fighting COVID-19. The team would be developing the coating using a combination of common polymers containing anti-microbial properties and re-purposable anti-viral molecules and materials used would make it a cost effective solution. Doctors and nurses, treating COVID-19 patients and hence susceptible to contamination due to their nature of work, will immensely benefit from this as it would add a layer of security for them while treating COVID-19 patients. Cost-effectiveness of the project would also help in mass-scale production. The researchers from the Department of Chemistry in IIT Kanpur will be designing the virucidal coating using polymers which can resist attachment of bacteria and virus. An additional protection will be included to the polymer coating using molecules that can either destabilize and/or neutralize corona viruses and other viruses like influenza. The combination of anti-microbial polymer coating and functionalized drugs is also expected to provide a synergistic antiviral effect. ""While the most used varieties of masks work by filtration and retention of pathogens and aerosols based on their size, immobilizing anti-microbial and anti-viral ingredients on the fabric can be useful in critical environments, and for extending the life, re-usability and safer handling and disposal of masks. This additional defense will be especially valuable if it can be added at a fraction of the cost of the mask”, said Professor Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science & Technology. The researchers in the team include, Prof. M.L.N.Rao, Professor, Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Dr Ashis K Patra, Associate Professor, Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and Dr Nagma Parveen, Assistant Professor, Department of  Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. The team aims to establish a basic prototype within 3 months and further, collaborate with potential industrial and/or start-up partners for its potential large-scale applications. The team will apply the proposed combination of polymer and repurposed drugs for coating standard healthcare utilities such as surgical masks, medical wear which can help in making medicated masks and medical wear (PPE). This system is expected to greatly help as preventive measures against infection caused by corona viruses and other flu viruses like influenza in healthcare settings where doctors and nurses are susceptible to contamination in treating infected patients. The cost-effectiveness of the design by using common polymers, repurposable anti-viral/virucidal drugs, and agents may also allow the cost-effective mass scale production of the medicated masks for the larger utilization in hospitals and for general use.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/4/4/IIT-Kanpur-researchers-to-design-a-cost-effective-virucidal-coating-of-surgical-masks-.html

DRDO develops sanitisation enclosures and face shields to save primarily healthcare professionals from COVID-19, 04-Apr-2020,,"In the ongoing efforts against COVID-19 pandemic, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has been using scientific endeavours to develop products in an accelerated manner. The DRDO laboratories are working with industry partners for volume production. Personnel Sanitisation Enclosure (PSE) Vehicle Research Development Establishment (VRDE), Ahmednagar, a DRDO Laboratory has designed full body disinfection chamber called as PSE. This walk through enclosure is designed for personnel decontamination, one person at a time. This is a portable system equipped with sanitiser and soap dispenser. The decontamination is started using a foot pedal at the entry. On entering the chamber, electrically operated pump creates a disinfectant mist of hypo sodium chloride for disinfecting. The mist spray is calibrated for an operation of 25 seconds and stops automatically indicating completion of operation. As per procedure, personnel undergoing disinfection will need to keep their eyes closed while inside the chamber. The system consists of roof mounted and bottom tanks with a total of 700 liters capacity. Approximately 650 personnel can pass through the chamber for disinfection until the refill is required. The system has see-through glass panels on side walls for monitoring purpose and is fitted with lights for illumination during night time operations. A separate operator cabin is provided to monitor overall operations. The system has been manufactured with the help of M/s D H Ltd, Ghaziabad, within a time span of four days. This system can be used for disinfection of personnel at the areas of controlled ingress and egress such as entry and exit to hospitals, malls, office buildings and critical installations. Full Face Mask (FFM) Research Centre Imarat (RCI), Hyderabad and Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL), Chandigarh, have developed face protection mask for health care professionals handling COVID-19 patients. Its light weight construction makes it convenient for comfortable wear for long duration. This design uses commonly available A4 size Over-Head Projection (OHP) film for face protection. The holding frame is manufactured using Fused Deposition Modeling (3D printing). Polylactic Acid filament is used for 3D printing of the frame. This thermoplastic is derived from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugarcane and is biodegradable. The face mask will be mass produced using injection moulding technique for volume production. One thousand face shields are being produced daily in TBRL and provided to Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh. Similarly 100 are produced at RCI and these have been handed over to Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), Hyderabad. A demand of 10,000 shields has been received from PGIMER and ESIC Hospitals based on successful user trials.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/4/4/DRDO-develops-sanitisation-enclosures-and-face-shields-.html
"Destructor of Obstacles, Ganesh Beyond Boundaries", 24-Aug-2020,- Prof. Rakesh Mohan Joshi & Dr. Indu Joshi,"Lord Ganesha, the destructor of all obstacles, is a true global Indian deity, worshipped as the First god ‘nirvighanam kuru me dev, sarva karyeshu sarvada’ to get rid of all hindrances before beginning of any task.  His infinite glory is beyond confines of time, circumstances, political and geographical boundaries of nation states. The present-day concept of globalization largely based on economic might is too myopic that grossly undermines India’s rich cultural heritage and its vast pervasion across geographies and cultures. Masses in India often confuse globalization with economic liberalization in the recent decades especially some economic measures taken in 1991. Not only Indian cultural practices but Indian deities are also revered and worshipped beyond boundaries since time immemorial. Lord Ganesha, the destructor of all obstacles, is a true global Indian deity, worshipped as the First god ‘nirvighanam kuru me dev, sarva karyeshu sarvada’ to get rid of all hindrances before beginning of any task.  His infinite glory is beyond confines of time, circumstances, political and geographical boundaries of nation states. The influence of Lord Ganesh is explicitly reflected during out travel across the world for our research expeditions mainly aimed at exploring cross-country Art, Culture and Markets. Western educated intellectuals including historians, archeologists, scientists and theologists alike, either abroad or under the India’s education system conceptualized by Macaulay, would leave no stone unturned to grossly undermine Indian culture and its reach. Even economically, India was the most powerful country in the world with over 32% share in the world GDP, at a time when the America was not even conceptualized, and the Europe was also in formative stages. However, besides trade, Indian culture and deities did have an international reach and acceptance. Even today, pseudo-intellectuals often make futile attempts to confine Ganesh in the boundaries of their thoughts. Indeed, the so-called scientific research methodologies involving complex mathematical modeling using a cobweb of statistics hampers the creativity in real sense. Ganesh is beyond abilities of human beings of logic and intellect, ‘yo buddhe partastu sah’. As envisaged in the fourteenth verse of the eighteenth chapter of the Bhagavad-Gita, 'devam chaivatra panchamam' meaning that the final success of any work is only when 'God' is wanted. Even a leave does not move without compassion of the ubiquitous Ganesh, in the living or non-living world. Ganesh in Americas: Epitome of auspiciousness (Mangal-murti) and destruction of obstacles (Vighna-vinashak), Lord Ganesh is revered and worshipped not only India but beyond boundaries as well. The Roman god 'Janus' has also been described by many historians as the form of Ganesha. In 'Inca' and 'Aztec' civilizations of South and Central American countries, such as Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Honders, the Hindu deities' assemblages are displayed on seeing temples and museums. The Ganesh-idols in the temple of Diego Riviera of Mexico City, and several Ganapati images in the Vera-Cruz and Quiragua of Guatemala explicitly proves the ubiquitous Ganapati in ancient America. The gobal Ganesha (Sho-ten) as a revered deity in Japan Ganesh in South East Asia: Ganesh depicted on Islamic Indonesia’s currency Ganesh in Indonesia: The day Indian government also realizes the power of ‘sarva vighnogh-vinash daksh, siddhi-vinayak Ganpati,  casting off its pseudo-secularism and places Ganesh at public places and the government offices similar to several South Asian countries, the ‘golden’ days of India would return. School Children learning about their forgotten First deity, Ganesh in Islamic Indonesia (Photo, Prof. Joshi, in Jakarta)  Ganesh in Thailand: Ganesh is the most revered deity in Thailand and known as 'Phra Phikanet' or 'Phra Phikanesuan'. Sight of Grandiose statues of Ganesh across Thailand, both in public and private places reveals the deep impact of Indian religion and culture.   A grand statue of Ganesh in the Central Word (Word Trade Center) of Bangkok, has been installed on the high throne as the god of business and diplomacy, where flowers, incense sticks and other items are offered to him with great reverence. In contrast to many South Asian countries, statues of Ganesh or any other Hindu deities are rarely visible in the government buildings and public places of ‘secular’ India, whereas entering into Bangkok’s Swarnbhoomi (Golden Land) International Airport, the sight of its spectacular massive statue of ‘samudra manthan’ (churing of oceans) brings one into Hindu mythological era. There exists a strong belief in the Buddhist Thailand the Airport is being protected by the massive statues and idols of Hindu deities including Ganesha besides several others and group of yakshas. The day Indian government also realizes the power of ‘sarva vighnogh-vinash daksh, siddhi-vinayak Ganpati,  who is proficient in eradicating all the troubles, obstacles and sins and bestower of success and accomplishments, casting off its pseudo-secularism and places Ganesh alongwith other Hindu deities at public places and the government offices similar to several South Asian countries, the ‘golden’ days of India would return.

"Jayanti of Paramabhattaraka Vidyadhiraja Sree Chattampi Swami Ji: “Here I met a remarkable man”, wrote Swami Vivekananda after meeting Chattampi Swamikal", 07-Sep-2020,,"Today marks the birth anniversary of the great sage, Vedanti, author and social reformer Paramabhattaraka Vidyadhiraja Sree Chattampi Swami Ji, who taught Swami Vivekananda the meaning of ‘Chinmudra’ during the latter’s Kerala visit. “Here I met a remarkable man”, wrote Swami Vivekananda after meeting Chattampi Swamikal at Kochi. Swamiji was born in Kannanmool, Thiruvananthapuram in 1853. Fondly known as Kunjan Pillai, Swamiji earned his name ‘Chattampi’, which means ‘monitor’ during his school days. After his education, he served as an accountant in the Government Secretariat. He learnt the art of ‘Hat yoga’ from Thaikkattu Ayyavu, a Tamil Pandit and hat-yogi. He also learnt Tamil Vedic works from Pandit Swaminatha Desika.  He became a disciple of the famous pandit and scholar Subha Jatapathikal.  He travelled throughout South India and attained knowledge in different languages and religions.  On return, he obtained expert training in the art of yoga from Admananda Swamikal. Chattampi Swamikal along with Sree Narayana Guru, led the Hindu renaissance movement in Kerala, to reform caste-ridden Hindu society of the late 19th century. He ardently opposed forced religious conversion and paid the missionaries back in the same coin, by writing ‘Kristumata Chedanam’, a critique of Christianity in 1890 as a rejoinder to many Christian Missionary books slandering Hindu Gods and scriptures. This scholastic-polemical work, written in accordance with the classical Indian Purva paksha tradition, ripped apart the logical fallacies in Christian theology, using his expertise in Tarka Shashtra. In order to resist forced religious conversion and fight slanderous missionary campaign against Hindu Dharma, Chattampi Swamiji formed an army of intellectual warriors in the late 19th - early 20th centuries and made them well versed in his work 'Christumata Chedanam' and sent them to all quarters of Kerala to counter Missionaries' propaganda and thwart proselytisation. “Here I met a remarkable man”, wrote Swami Vivekananda when he met Chattampi Swamikal at Ernakulam.  He made this remark on hearing the clarifications on ‘Chinmudra’ from Chattampi Swamikal. Pracheena Malayalam, Vedadhikara Niroopanam, Sree Chakra Poojakalpam, Jeevakarunya Niroopanam, Adibhasha etc. are the other major works of Chattampi Swamikal. Vedadhikara Niroopanam is considered to be his masterpiece which argued that Vedas are for all Hindus. In his famous work Vedadhikara Niroopanam, Swamiji argued and established that Vedas are not just meant for Brahmins, but for all Hindus.  He proved that even Sudras had the right to learn Vedas as knowledge is essential to all people like food and water and that nobody has the right to deny them. Swamiji established Sree Vidhyadhiraja Theerthapada Paramabhattraka Ashram in 1089 (ME) (1914 AD). “Ascetic and holy man who tried to break the Brahmin hold on the performance of religious ceremonies.  Attacked caste and associated with Izhavas.  Said to have taught yoga to Sri Narayana Guru,” wrote historian Robin Jeffri.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/7/Jayanti-of-Paramabhattaraka-Vidyadhiraja-Sree-Chattampi-Swami-Ji.html
NCL-supported start-up innovations join the fight against COVID-19, 10-Apr-2020,,"Jyoti Singh The world is combatting COVID-19 pandemic with all its might. In India, various institutions are working hard at saving lives of people. Two innovative technologies developed by the start-ups supported by the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune, stand out and can be of great help in this fight against coronavirus. One is the Digital InfraRed (IR) thermometer and the other is the Oxygen Enrichment Unit (OEU). The handheld digital IR thermometer is developed by NCL’s Venture CenterIncubate. For the non-contact thermometer, mobile phone or power banks can be used as a power source. The design of IR thermometers, complete know-how, and mass manufacturing-ready hardware and software design have been made available to manufacturers across India for free. This is an effort to enable a large number of manufacturers to manufacture the thermometers and cater to their local demands. “We are trying to bring simplicity in the design and share it with everyone so that the manufacturers need not to spend time of the R&D,” said Pratik Kulkarni, co-founder, BMeK. As of now, the production of this thermometer is is being scaled up in partnership with BEL (Bharat Electronics Ltd, Pune). In the coming two weeks, about 100 prototype units will be made for pilot distribution and testing at TUV Rheinland India Pvt. Ltd Bangalore. The Oxygen Enrichment Unit is the other technology that is in great demand in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. As the lungs of COVID-19 patients get badly affected, the OEU can do the function of a ventilator by increasing the oxygen concentration from 21-22% to 38-40% from the ambient air. The OEU technology has been developed by CSIR-NCL and Genrich Membranes, a start-up innovation venture founded by Dr.UlhasKharul, Head of Polymer Science & Engineering Division at NCL. “The surrounding air is being passed through the polymeric membrane with the help of compressor that can pressurize the air in the membrane to make it oxygen-rich. This is a cost-effective way to administer oxygen to the people who want supplementary oxygen,” said Dr Kharul. The uniqueness of the OEU is that it can be used in both home and hospital settings. The prototype units are ready at Pune and will be sent to TUV Rheinland India Pvt. Ltd, Bangalore, for testing and validation. About 10 OEU machines will be assembled by NCL-BEL in Pune and after the trials, scale-up will be done.

Indian researchers start working on novel coronavirus genome sequencing, 08-Apr-2020,Jyoti Singh,"The novel coronavirus is a new virus and researchers are trying to figure out all the different aspects of it. Two institutes of Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi have started working together on the whole genome sequencing of the novel coronavirus. “This will help us to understand the evolution of the virus, how dynamic is it and how fast it imitates. This study will help us to know how fast it evolves and what are the future aspects of it” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, Director, CCMB while speaking with India Science Wire. Whole-genome sequencing is the method used to determine the complete DNA sequence of a specific organism’s genome. The approach for sequencing the latest coronavirus involves getting samples from patients that have are found to be positive and sending these samples to a sequencing centre. Genome sequencing need very large number of samples for study. “Without much data if you make any conclusion that may not be right. At the moment we are accumulating as many sequencings as we can and once, we have few hundred sequencing with us then we will be able to make many inferences from many biological aspects of this virus” said Dr Mishra. Three to four people from each institute are continuously working on the whole genome sequencing. In the next 3-4 weeks researchers would be able to get at least 200-300 isolates and this information would help them to make some further conclusion about behaviour of this virus. For this purpose,National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune has also been requested to give virus that has been isolated from different places. This will help the scientists to cover the whole country to get a bigger and clearer picture. This will help the institutes to establish the family tree of the virus. Dr Mishra told that based on this they can study from where the virus has come which strain has more similarity, the varied mutations and which strain is weak and what strain is strong. “This will give some strategic clues to understand it and to implement better isolation strategies” he said. In addition to this the institute has also increased the testing capacity. A large number of people are undergoing testing and they would go for mass screening. This will help them to identify the number of positive cases and then send them for isolation or quarantine.

When Marxists scuttled Akkitham’s chance to win Jnanpith long back, 24-Sep-2020,,"Leftists detest the great poet because he left behind Marxism and embraced Hindu universalism The Jnanpith Award came in Mahakavi Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri’s way rather late, though his name is said to have figured on the list of candidates a few times in the past. The 94-year-old Akkitham (as he is popularly known) is one of the most revered poets of Malayalam literature. In 2007, there was near unanimity on his name among the members of the award selection committee. But Sachithanandan, a staunch Marxist, former Secretary of the Sahitya Akademi and a member of the jury, allegedly played the spoilsport and lobbied for poet ONV Kurup, who was much younger to Akkitham. Finally, the jury selected ONV Kurup for the award. Being a Communist, ONV Kurup was the favoured candidate for the Marxists. For Marxists, Akkitham was a renegade who had deserted the party ideology and joined forces with the ‘class enemy’. If the Marxists had their way, even now Akkitham would not have got the award. This is not to dispute ONV Kurup’s calibre or greatness as a poet or his contribution to Malayalam literature. True to their nature, after the announcement of the award, the Communists were quick to draw mileage out of this. One of the first persons to congratulate him was none other than the present Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayan. Born on March 18, 1926 in Kumaranalloor in Palakkad district as the son of Vasudevan Nampoothiri and Parvathy Antharjanam, Akkitham was drawn to revolutionary reform movement initiated by VT Bhattathiripad to end social evils in his Brahmin community. Akkitham wholeheartedly participated in the movement. To learn English education, he cut his tuft and adopted western dress, which was a taboo among Brahmins then. As a student, he participated in the Congress movement and wanted to contribute to nation-building. He took part in the Quit India movement and other agitations against the British and got arrested. The purpose of his social and political activity was to establish an egalitarian society. He supported casteless marriages, widow remarriage and women education. Endowed with a fertile mind, Akkitham was attracted to socialism and Marxism and worked closely with Communist leader EMS Namboothiripad. The Communist Party twice tried to give him party membership which he declined. By that time, the incisive thinker in him realised the limitations of Communism. He strayed into Indian philosophy, which he found more profound and complete, much to the chagrin of the Marxists. His unending quest brought him close to Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy. One of the persons who left a lasting impression on Akkitham was Gandhiji. In one of his poems, he compares him to Krishna and says both have taken birth for ‘dharma sansthapanam’ (re-establishment of dharma). The biggest criticism of the Communists against Akkitham is that he left his “progressive and revolutionary ideals of his youth days” behind and adopted “regressive ways” such as teaching Vedas and performing yagnas.  For them, he was a Brahmin obscurantist who was trying to bring back ‘Manuvaad’.  While EMS had lamented that his study of Vedas and rituals in younger age was a waste of time, Akkitham used his knowledge in Vedas as a tool to spiritually uplift people belonging to so-called lower castes who were denied that right and bring about equality. He found himself quite at home with this ‘evolutionary’ idea than phony ‘imported’ revolutionary ideas that thrived on widening fault lines and creating social schisms. Commonality of these ideas brought him close to the Sangh. Akkitham served as president of Tapasya, a Sangh-inspired platform for promotion of art and literature, for more than seven years. The progressives who enjoyed monopoly over the area of art and literature had to yield space to a group of writers who were proud of their Bharateeya cultural ethos. He wholeheartedly attended functions organised by RSS. An unabashed supporter of the Sangh’s initiatives to bring about social change, Akkitham witnessed how his dream of a casteless society is being realised in real life. In an interview to Mathrubhumi, he says: “I happened to mention Kesavadev’s speech in which he asked to burn Ramayana, during the ninetieth birth anniversary of Balagokulam founder M. A. Krishnan. Today everybody has started reading Ramayana. Ramayana is the soul of India. …I recalled Madhavji (former Sangh pracharak) who attempted to renovate temples and make casteless Brahmins priests of temples. Both were my friends. The crux of my speech was that everyone started reading Ramayana due to the efforts taken by them.” In the literary and cultural landscape of Kerala which has been vitiated by the vulgar play of ideas of the so-called progressives, Akkitham is like the holy plume of smoke emanating from the yagna kundam, carrying with it the ever enlivening and cleansing fragrance of celestial herbs.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/24/When-Marxists-scuttled-Akkitham-s-chance-to-win-Jnanpith-long-back.html
“Jnanpith gets Akkitham”, 22-Sep-2020,,"The Jnanpith Award will be presented to great Malayalam poet Shri Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri on September 24 “Jnanpith gets Akkitham,” that was how M Satheesan, Malayalam literary and political critic described it when the mass media beamed the announcement by the Jnanpith Award Committee that Akkitham Achuthan Namboodiri is being honoured with the country’s biggest literary prize for the year 2019. Akkitham, as he is popularly known, is Kerala’s one and only Maha Kavi (Great Poet) who is a household name for his works which has played a major role in demolishing and destroying orthodoxy and conservatism associated with the Brahmin community to which he belongs. Aged 94, he is the last surviving social reformer who revolutionised the lives of not only the Namboodiri households but even that of people in lower strata of the Kerala society. “I would like to be known more as an astrologer because my forte has been astrology, a science. I learnt scientific astrology. Poetry is something like a hobby for me and I scribble the occasional thoughts which come to my mind,” said the nonagenarian who has not lost any of his mental prowess. Parappanangaadi Unnikrishna Panickar , tantrik scholar and ace astrologer, had a hearty laugh when he was told the comment made by Akkitham. Jnanpith award is a recognition which reached Devayanam, the poet’s Mana traditional Namboodiri house) at Kumaranalloor in Kerala’s Palakkadu district. Akkitham, who set the State’s cultural and political platforms ablaze with his revolutionary poems in 1950s and 1960s had forecast the collapse of Communism and disintegration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics way back in 1970s itself. He has not written much of poetry during the last two decades because of his engagement with translation of Sree Maha Bhagavatham, the great purana of Bharata, into Malayalam. The Bhagavatam, all slokas of which were as immortal as that of the great Purana, found new beauty in Malayalam language as Akkitham sculpted the work with alphabets and grammar in a style hitherto unheard and unseen in Malayalam. The sloka “Narayanaaksharam Punya Jihwagre Yasya Varthathe Narayanasthamanwethi Valsam Gowreeva Valsalaa… became “Naavinthumbil Punya Narayanaaksharamirikkukil Narayanan Thedi Varum Pasu Valsatheyennapol..”  The beauty of the translation was stated by Prof P G Haridas, president, Tapasya, Kerala’s largest and oldest literary and cultural forum of which Akkitham himself was the founder president : “ We could not have asked for more. I rate this as literature at its peak,” said Haridas, who describes Akkitham as the all-time great of 21st century’s Malayalam literature. Though his friends and followers, including Jeevan Kumar, editor, Yajnopaveetham and Prof K P Sasidharan of Kozhikode are unanimous that the top award should  have reached his hands at least two decades ago. “It is true that Akkitham is last of the titans of Malayalam literature. He is a born poet while the new age writers are light years behind him. They are yet to pen down lines which would get engraved in our minds,” said Prof Sasidharan, former head of the department, Malayalam,  Guruvayurappan College, Kozhikode and Kerala’s leading literary critic. The author of “The Epic of the 20th Century”, the best poetical work to emerge in Malayalam literary landscape sans any media blitzkrieg was not amused or enthused by the country’s biggest award a writer could aspire for. “I feel nothing. How can you be happy when you see the country moving backwards,?” asked Akkitham on a Sunday morning when this writer met him at Devayaanam. He said he is yet to find out the reason for the backward journey of the nation. “Everything is decided by God Almighty. Daivadheenam Jagatsarvam! Nothing belongs to us. All pre-destined by Him,” Akkitham pointed upwards to the sky. Akkitham’s sorrow began the day when the Jawaharlal Nehru rejected the request by the freedom fighters of the country to make Sanskrit the national language. “All aberrations in our educational system started the day it was decided by Nehru to make Hindi the national language. Had Sanskrit been the national language, the country would have been the knowledge house of the world,” said Akkitham. He attributed his knowledge of Sanskrit and Sanskrit literature as the reasons behind his poetry. “The great poets of yesteryears, Ulloor S Parameswara Iyer, P Kunhiraman Nair, Kumaran Aasan, Vallathol Narayana Menon, Edassery Govindan Nair, Olappamanna Subramanian Namboodirippadu, Vailoppilli Sreedhara Menon were all Sanskrit scholars. Same was the case with novelists like Uroob (P C Kuttikrishnan), Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, Keshava Dev, Sanjayan who were all well-read in Sanskrit. Their works had originality in them and were the literature of global standards. Do we have writers of such genre now? M T Vasudevan Nair fits the bill. But others do not come anywhere near the above-mentioned writers,” said Akkitham. He said the world of Malayalam poetry is weak and in the death bed.  “A person who thinks of himself/herself   as a poet, novelist, short story writer or a literary critic does not become anyone of these. One who considers himself as a born artist is doomed to fail. All living entities are manifestations of God. One’s confidence should not be in the pride but in one’s infinity, depth and completeness,” explained the grand old man of Malayalam literature. This was his response when asked why modern-day writers fail to come out works matching that of the old-timers. Akkitham pointed out that literature, be it poem, novel, short story or drama, is an ongoing process. “What Valmiki and Kalidasa wrote were based on their own world of experiences. Each person born in this earth has his/her own  universe of experiences and they should be able to realize the same. Don’t you remember the old Persian saying, ‘ You fool, look into the heart and write’,”  Akkitham reminds the new generation. Coming back to the topical issues haunting India, the anti-CAA rallies and Shaheenbag kind of demonstrations happening across the country, Akkitham said he does not rule out the possibility of India getting disintegrated further. “The epicenter of all our problems was the division of the country into India and Pakistan. The communal discord which we see now had its origin  from the birth of Pakistan. Jawaharlal Nehru himself is responsible for it,” said Akkitham who had closely watched the shadow boxings that took place in the political arena  during the days leading to the emergence of India from the shackles of slavery. Though India gained political freedom, the cultural and literary spheres were seized by the Communists. ‘Mulk Raj Anand and Ali Sardar Jafri were their foot soldiers. Both of them were experts in distorting and interpreting facts to suit the convenience of the Communists. They created a bloc of writers who were oriented to the imported concept of literature. It is sad that we do not have writers to counter this western onslaught on out culture and tradition,” said Akkitham. Mulk Raj Anand had figured in the life history of Malayatoor Ramakrishnan a former IAS officer who was a widely read Malayalam writer. Ramakrishnan in his reminiscences has mentioned how Anand while on a visit to the former’s college had impressed upon him not to waste life in this small Kerala and persuaded  him to come to Bombay which was waiting for intellectuals like him. “When I went to the palatial residence of Anand in Bombay’s Malabar Hill, he  refused to meet me. And finally when I managed to meet him, he asked me to get the hell out the city and go back to Kerala. This was the true Mulk raj Anand,” Ramakrishnan wrote in his memoirs! That much for India’s Left ideology. The poet also made it clear that he had nothing to do with RSS or the Hindutwa. “I was more into learning Marx and his ideology. But having read  Sanskrit works, Vedas and Upanishats, I understood that the Marxian ideology was doomed to fail because it would not and could not match the greatness of Indian culture, tradition or heritage,” he said. Akkitham had played a major role in getting rid of some of the outdated and irrelevant traditions prevailing in the Namboodiri community. The re-marriage of Namboodiri widows, the thought of Namboodiri women going for work were unthinkable and unimaginable even during the early phase of the 20th century. He together with V T Bhattathirippadu and E M S Namboodirippadu (yes, the same EMS who was the first chief minister of Kerala) worked overtime and made use of all kinds of platforms and avenues to end this social evil and dogma. The poet blames the complacency which had set in the Namboodiri community as the reason behind these social evils. “We have to blame ourselves for the same as the Namboodiris were financially sound , up in the social hierarchy and had nothing to worry about. But when they came across reality in life and faced difficulties, they had to change, change permanently,”  said Akkitham. The same was the case with the oppressed and the depressed classes who were denied opportunities to learn Sanskrit, Vedas and Upanishats for centuries. Akkitham was the leader of the social revolution which turned the prevailing customs upside down and threw the doors opened for people in the lower strata to learn the great Indian system of knowledge and tradition. “I was totally against the practice of Brahminism by an exclusive class. Nothing should be denied to the people of this great land in the name of religion, caste and class which are all man made fencings and rules,” said Akkitham. The Sri Ramaswamy Temple at Kadavallur near his hometown is a standing monument of Akkitham’s tenacity. The annual anyonyam (an intellectual wrestling event) on Rig Veda held in the months of November-December see vedic scholars from all over the globe assembling at Kadavallur. Only the best scholars could graduate as champions. The age-old Vedic debate contest is held under the supervision of Kadavallur Anyonya Parishat and is described as the one and only event of this kind taking place anywhere in the world. “My interest in Communism had its origins in our vedas and Upanishads. But the moment I learnt that the ideology of Marx has no humane face, I gave it up. There are people who describe me as Sanghi, RSS and even BJP. I do not have anything to do with these organisations. I had not read what Dr K B Hedgewar or M S Golwalkar had written about Hindutwa. But what I had professed as Sanatana Dharma could be seen in their writings and speeches. Similar was the case with Deendayal Upadhyaya who was the proponent of Integral Humanism. Upadhyaya stood  for a political and economic ideology which had strong mooring in the teachings of India’s sages and rishis. This was what made us to think alike,” explained Akkitham. The poet explained with elan that the theory of ideology is engraved in the age-old Indian ethos. “The socialism being spread by westerners would succeed only if it is implemented through Indian culture. The Indian philosophy existed much before the  advent of religions. We following the so-called Gregorian calendar itself is a blunder. The modern day calendar says this is the 2020th year. So, where were we before 2020?  The CE 2020 is the same as that of 5121 Kali Yuga. There are 4,26, 882 years remaining in Kali Yuga before we advent to the next Yuga. Krita Yuga was 1,72, 8000 years long while Treta Yuga was 12, 96,000 years long. Who and how these years could be accounted? It could be done only with the Indian system of knowledge,” said Akkitham. He is blunt in his opinion that the Gregorian calendar is absolutely wrong. Akkitham who has authored thousands of poems in his 94 years (and counting!) and who was described as a Left of the Centre writer suddenly became a persona non grata for the comrades when he questioned and challenged the social evils being practised by the Marxists. The CPI(M) is known for its ideology of physically annihilating the enemies. This was unacceptable to the poet in Akkitham who questioned the practice in his works like The Legend of the 20th Century and other poems. No wonder, the Marxists fielded a political Bhikshamdehi to attack him with terms like Fascist and communalist! The poet blames the inertia that has set in the governments which ruled India since 1947. “The first thing they should have done was to ban  religious conversion. Besides the creation of Pakistan by tearing apart India, the unbridled freedom given to foreigners to convert Hindus to other religions played havoc with the soul of the country. Mahatma Gandhi, Father of the Nation, was against the practice of religious conversion. I mentioned about this and advocated strongly for the same way back in 1975. We simply adore the picture of Gandhi but we fail to see his heart,” said Akkitham. While addressing the Gandhi Peace Foundation delegates at Kozhikode in Kerala, the Maha Kavi pointed  this out and quoted a sloka “Even a Gold Vessel cannot cover the power of truth”. The 94-year-young Akkitham Achuthan Nampoodiri is not enthusiastic about discussing poetry. “My mission as a poet is over. It is my passion in astrology which sustains my energy and spirit. Now it is for the younger generation to take off from where me and my colleagues left. The world of literature is vast and is in an ever-expanding mode. So, there is lot to write, lot to speak.. it is an Akshaya Paatra.. which is eternally overflowing. Those who are keen in writing poems and stories can get unlimited quantity of spirit and energy from it. But please remember, don’t try to write just for the sake of writing. If you do that, it will never be literature,” the poet in Akkitham wound up the session and went back to a brief siesta. While coming back from Devayanam, one cannot hold back the prayer to God almighty. “This person should remain among us for another hundred years. He is the divine musician deputed by the supreme power to sing His songs and hymns”.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/22/Jnanpith-gets-Akkitham.html
SCTIMST scientists develop disinfection gateway & facemask disposal bin to fight COVID-19, 10-Apr-2020,,"Professor Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST asserts, ""Disinfection of people, garments, surfaces and used disposable protective gears are vital to break the chain of transmission” Scientists at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), Trivandrum, Kerala, an autonomous institute under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, have designed two technologies to fight COVID-19 pandemic. Chitra Disinfection Gateway is one of the two technology designed by SCTIMST scientistsJithin Krishan and Subash VV from the Division of Medical Instrumentation for the decontamination of people, one at a time. It is a portable system equipped with a system for generating Hydrogen peroxide mist and UV based decontamination facility. Hydrogen Peroxide fumes will decontaminate the body, hands, and clothes of a person. The UV system will decontaminate the chamber.The whole system is electronically controlled. The sensors mounted in the chamber will detect the entry of a person and start the Hydrogen Peroxide mist generation process.The person is required to walk through the chamber to its end. When the person exits, the system will shut off the hydrogen peroxide fumigation system and will turn on the UV lamp inside the chamber to decontaminate it. After the UV light is switched offautomatically after a prescribed time, the chamber is ready for the next person. The whole process takes only 40 seconds.The system has see-through glass panels on sidewalls for monitoring and is fitted with lights for illumination during use. The design and Know-how have been transferred to HMT Machine Tools, Ernakulam, Kerala. The second technology,Chitra UV Based Facemask Disposal Bin designed by Subash VVfrom SCTIMST, is a UV Based Facemask Disposal Bin. The ‘UV Based Facemask Disposal Bin’ can be used by health workers in hospitals and in public places where decontamination of used facemask, overhead covers, face shields,and so on are required to break the infection chain. Face masks are a must-have item due to the current Covid-19 outbreak, but the used masks are hazardous waste and must be disposed of properly. The waste collectors are at risk of being exposed to COVID19 while performing their duties. Instead of just throwing used face masks into the waste bin, disinfecting the used mask is a must. The Design and Know-how transferred to HMT Machine Tools, Ernakulam, Kerala. Professor Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST said, ""Disinfection of people, garments, surfaces and used disposable protective gears are vital to break the chain of transmission. The use of hydrogen peroxide spray and ultraviolet light in appropriate doses are two robust weapons in this fight, both of which are used in the innovations being discussed here.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/4/10/SCTIMST-scientists-develop-disinfection-gateway.html
India to explore novel blood plasma therapy for COVID-19, 11-Apr-2020,TV Venkateswaran and Jyoti Singh,"Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) an Institution of National Importance under the Department of Science and Technology has obtained a go-ahead for taking a bold step to provide innovative treatment to patients suffering from COVID-19 disease.  Technically called “convalescent-plasma therapy,”, the treatment aim is to use the immune power gained by a recovered person to treat a sick person. Indian council for medical research (ICMR) the top authorising body in India has given approval to the SCTIMST for carrying out the novel treatment.  “We have applied for age cut off to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for permissions for relaxation of the norms for blood donation,” said Dr Asha Kishore, Director, SCTIMST. What is it: When a pathogen like novel coronavirus infect, our immune systems produce antibodies. Like the police dogs, the antibodies span out to identify and mark the invading virus. White blood cells attach the identified intruders, and the body gets rid of the infection. The therapy, like blood transfusion, harvests the antibody from a recovered patient and ingest into a sick person. Helped by the antibody, the immune system mounts robust combat on the virus. What are antibodies: Antibodies are one of the front-line immune response to an infection by a microbe. They are a particular type of proteins secreted by immune cells called B lymphocytes when they encounter an invader, such as a novel coronavirus.  The immune system designs antibodies that are highly specific to each invading pathogen. A particular antibody and its partner virus are made for each other. How the treatment is given: Blood is drawn from a person who has recovered from COVID-19 sickness. The serum is separated and screened for virus-neutralizing antibodies. Convalescent serum, that is the blood serum obtained from one who has recovered from an infectious disease and especially rich in antibodies for that pathogen, is then administered to a COVID-19 patient. The sick acquires passive immunisation. “Potential donor would be examined before the blood serum is extracted and given to a sick person. First, the swab test must be negative and the potential donor has to be declared as cured. Then the recovered person has to wait for two weeks. Or else the potential donor should be asymptomatic for at least 28 days. Either of the two is mandatory” said Dr Kishore while speaking with India Science Wire. Who will be receiving the treatment: “Initially we will try in a small number of patients. At present it is permitted as an experimental therapy for restricted use for severely affected patients only. We will be getting the informed consent before they are recruited. This will be conducted as a clinical trial” said Dr Kishore. COVID clinics of five medical college hospitals will be partnering. How is it different from vaccination: This therapy is akin to passive immunization. When a vaccine is administrated, the immune system produces the antibodies. Thus, in a later date, when the vaccinated person is infected by that pathogen, the immune system releases the antibodies and neutralise the infection. Vaccination provides lifelong immunity. In the case of passive antibody therapy, the effect lasts only up to the time the antibodies injected remain the bloodstream. The protection given is temporary. The mother transfers antibodies through breast milk to an infant before the child could build her own immunity. History:  Is it effective:  Is it safe?:  How long the antibodies will remain in the recipient?: After the antibody serum is given, it will stay on the recipient for at least three to four days. During this period, the sick person will recover. Research reports from the USA and China indicate that the beneficial effect of transfusion plasma is obtained in the first three to four days and not later.

Indian researchers to work for COVID-19 vaccine, 15-Apr-2020,,"Jyoti Singh The swell of novel coronavirus appears not abating. In just a few months from the outbreak, it has reached around 210 countries, took lives of more than one lakh people. The numbers are climbing. In an effort to place a hurdle before the runaway train, scientists across the globe are racing to develop a drug that can cure or a vaccine that stop its spread.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a call to all the scientific community from India to work together and come up with some solution for this problem. Answering to this call Dr Shekhar C Mande, Director General, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has said that the CSIR labs would be engaged to discover a potent vaccine for novel coronavirus. “We have decided to commence our research and development for developing a vaccine from today,” said Dr Mande. Further he said confidently that “CSIR would try hard to start the clinical trials for the vaccine in the coming weeks”. He made this announcement during an interview given to a national news channel. CSIR would collaborate with two industries.  There is one vaccine named mycobacterium-w that is still is being used against leprosy. CSIR is seeing a potential in that old-time tested vaccine.  “We consider this vaccine as BCG’s (BacilleCalmette-Guérin) cousin this can be used against corona” he said. The second approach would try to inactivate the corona virus particle. CSIR is partnering with another industry for this R&D. He also said that in these trying times to have an effective and timely response, it includes digital and molecular surveillance; rapid and economical diagnostics; new drugs or repurposing of drugs and associated production processes; hospital assistive devices and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE); and, supply chain and logistics support systems. The CSIR would be joining hands with academia and industry in this effort right from the beginning.  Dr Mande said “All sectors have come on the same platform to work together. Industries, scientists, scientific institutions and private sector agencies have come forward and we are working hand in hand for this.” Institute of Genomic and Integrated Biology (IGIB) while working on the rapid and economical diagnostics vertical has prepared paper-strip test for corona which will be low cost and affordable in Indian conditions. As a part of digital and molecular surveillance vertical Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and IGIB, two institutes of eminence under the CSIR network have commenced genome sequencing of the novel corona virus from Indian patients. The sequencing and analysis of the way the genome is evolving will help the researchers to understand the behaviour, virulence and spread of the virus.

NIPER-Guwahati designs innovative 3D products to fight COVID-19, 11-Apr-2020,,"Sunderarajan Padmanabhan Researchers at the National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research- Guwahati (NIPER-G) have come out with two products that promise to be of great help in the fight against the current pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 infection in the world. The first product is a 3D-printed hands-free object that could be used to help open or close doors, windows, drawers (both vertical and horizontal), and refrigerator handle, or press elevator buttons, and laptop/desktop keyboards, including turning the switch buttons on/off. Doors, windows, switch buttons, elevator buttons, drawers handle, refrigerator handle, and laptop/desktop keyboards are some of the most germ-infested objects in houses, hospitals, factories, companies, institutes, organizations, and other buildings.In this current situation of the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19, this aspect may play a key role in transmitting infection from one person to another through bare hand contacts or contaminated surface source. The researchers came up with the design for the fabrication of the 3D-printed object after a detailed analysis of several resources for risk measurement and on how viruses spread through bare hands. Dr. U.S.N Murty, Director, NIPER-G, noted that the product was easy to design, and was amenable to the rapid development of prototypes. It was also handy, user friendly, non-fragile and easy to clean with the existing sanitizers or any alcoholic disinfectant. The second product is a 3D-printed antimicrobial face-shield to control the spread of novel coronavirus. It was designed after a thorough study to understand how viruses spread through oral, ophthalmic, olfactory and other body cavities. The face shield is also easy to design and it is possible to have rapid development of prototypes. It is also low cost, easy to wear, has good chemical stability, non-fragile and is easy to clean with the existing sanitizers or any alcoholic disinfectant. Dr.Murty noted that being a premier institute of national importance, NIPER-G endeavoured to help the country in fighting coronavirus through quick validated prototype/product development and deployment. “NIPER-G is committed to provide useful contributions cum solutions”.

Indian researchers to develop a new kit to detect COVID-19 infection, 15-Apr-2020,Sunderarajan Padmanabhan,"Researchers at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Thiruvananthapuram are in the final stages of developing a kit that promises to help detect SARS CoVID-19 infection as early as four days post-infection of the virus. The kit will be able to detect two types of antibodies - Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG). IgM is the first antibody that appears in human body when it is exposed to a virus or any other antigen. Presence of IgG antibody in the body, in contrast, is indicative of an individual's immune status to particular pathogens. Thus, if a person is found to have IgM antibodies even while being asymptomatic, it can be taken that he or she is infected. The person can thenbe isolated and sent for treatment. However, if someone is found to have IgG antibodies, it can be considered that the person has already had the infection and would be immune to new infections. This kit is being developed in collaboration with uBIO technologies, which is a company incubated at RGCB’s BioNest facility at Kochi. The company has been producing diagnostic kits and other such devices for DRDO and other organisations and has been exporting its products to over 25 countries.

Bharatiya Acharyas and Epidemics in China: Historical perspective on Control and Cure, 28-Apr-2020,Dr Shashibala ,"Chinese historical chronicles acknowledge that Indian sciences and scientists were successful in controlling contagious diseases and epidemics. Great Indian acharyas were famous for their curing skills and they also translated medical texts and prescriptions from Sanskrit into Chinese. Coronavirus, a new disease has terrorized the world struggling hard to find its cause and remedy. It emerged suddenly, infected lakhs and even killed thousands. Media brings shocking news every day. Thousands in critical condition are to be treated; medical facilities are crumbling; the world is up in arms to stop the contagious disease trying hard to find causes behind it. Destruction of ecological balance, violation of ozonosphere, shortage of freshwater, and extinction of biological species is endangering human existence. The world accepts that following the western philosophy of accepting man as master of nature, we have damaged the fabric of nature and have even intruded into the animal world. It is a world of scientific advancement with an open mind. Let us pause and think, if there was or can be any possibility of any solution in the Eastern mode of thought and practice. The question is— are there any leads to researches to find remedies in such situations. When I received a message from a friend in Singapore that people in Chinese monasteries are performing homam to contain the disease, felt duty-bound to write this article as an answer to the question— do we need to have faith in Indian medical science, its scientific culture, practices, and connect between science and spirituality? Where science stops spirituality begins to work. Many scientists are doing research on ancient Indian practices, mapping them scientifically, and showing positive results, acknowledging ancient Indian ways and means to protect the environment to save humanity from infections and viruses through havan/homa, planting specific trees and plants, boosting immunity to fight diseases through pranayama and yoga etc.. The list is long but here I am focusing on the Chinese historical chronicles that acknowledge Indian sciences and scientists controlling contagious diseases and epidemics. Dialogue Between Two Civilisations There has been a dialogue among civilizations over past centuries. Chinese historical chronicles refer to curing diseases, stopping storms and epidemics, protection from fatal strikes of lightning etc. by Indian acharyas. It happened with the entry of Buddhism which was taken to China to mitigate suffering and make the people happy wiping tears of agony and distress from the eyes of the people. Apart from sowing the seeds of love and compassion, meditation and enlightenment, democracy and equality, social reforms and imperial virtue, cheering up the downtrodden, introducing temple culture and monastic structure, medical science penetrated deep into the Chinese system. Indian Acharyas Controlling Epidemics in China An Indian acharya presented a perfume to the Chinese Han Emperor Wu during 2nd-1st century BC. At first, the Emperor was not much attracted to the egg-like presents. Just then a severe epidemic broke out in Ch’ang-an taking away many lives. The Indian asked the Emperor to burn that. Its fumigation stopped the epidemic and even resurrected the dead. Its perfume spread to an area of 50 kilometres and its effect lasted for three months. The Emperor was grateful, conferred great honours on the Indian guest, presented a special dinner, and bid farewell to him. This is given in the “Collection of Information on Things of Universe” written by Zhang Hua (232-300AD). A Chinese historical record “General Records of Buddhist Patriarchs” was compiled in 1296. It gives details of activities of Indians in China. According to it a monk from Bharat, Hala Haraka/Hari Vikrama helped the Chinese to stop a terrible epidemic with medicine and charms/mantras in Loyang, an Imperial city of Northern China in 287. It stopped a devastating epidemic in the Imperial capital Chang-an and saved thousands of lives. Such events indicate a great reputation of Indian perfume medicine and fumigating with them in ancient China. Indians Curing Incurables in China An Indian Acharya Jivaka went via sea route and arrived in Loyang. He became famous as a doctor who could cure incurable diseases around 306 AD. He treated the Governor of Hengyang province Teng Yongen. He was not able to walk because of problem in his foot being paralyzed for many years. This is detailed in the historical work “Biographies of Eminent Monks”, an important work on Indo-Chinese relations contains information about 257 monks, both Indian and Chinese who played a key role in the dissemination of Indian culture to China. Apart from curing incurable diseases, there are references to Indian magicians performing rejoining of severed tongue, spitting fire, swallowing a knife and rejoining broken cloth. Curing Chinese Suffering From Contagious Diseases Another Indian acharya Buddhchinga was a great doctor, an astronomer and an astrologer. Looking at his capacities he was known as a magician. He had studied in Kashmir under famous Buddhist masters. He could recite scriptures in millions of words. He had reached the then capital of China Loyang in 310 AD. At that time the ruler Shi Le was helped by Buddhachinga to win in battles and get his army cured suffering from a contagious disease. When he cured Shi Le’s army from infectious disease people were so impressed that they embraced Buddhism en masse. Shi Le appointed Buddhachinga as Rajya Guru. Shi Le’s successor bestowed even greater honours and patronage on him. He used to attend court sessions, crown prince and top courtiers used to escort him, was given standing ovation when entering the court, and he was offered a seat  by the side of the Emperor. Courtiers used to address him as great monk. There was so much enthusiasm that Buddhaching could build 893 temples in North China. The Chinese historiography remembered him as “Shengsheng” meaning ‘divine monk’. His disciples actively worked in China following the footsteps of their guru. Fumigation by Indian acharya in china saved many lives during epidemic Indian perfumes began to enter China in 98 BC when the Kushana Empire presented a magic incense to the Imperial court of Han Dynasty. A guest from Bharat to China presented three pieces of incense that resurrected many dead to life in the capital of Ch’ang-an during an epidemic. Chinese began to use Chandan calling it zhantan; turmeric and coriander became a part of Chinese cuisine. Turmeric was called yujinxiang meaning fragrance that gathers gold. In Chinese Buddhist literature Buddha’s country is called ‘fragrant land’. Buddhism introduced the ritual of incense burning and filled the Chinese life with the concept of fumigation. Buddhist temples were designated as ‘houses of fragrant fire’ (=havan) and Buddhist organization as ‘society of fragrant fire’ (hotri sangha). Money donated by people was called ‘money of fragrant fire’(=havan nidhi). Chinese began to burn incense for a good cause.   The expression ‘fragrant for burning fiercely’ indicated ‘thriving religious activities’ and ‘fragrant fire extinguishes’ meant religious activities coming to a halt. Pilgrims, donors and lay disciples engaging in religious activities were called ‘having a date with fragrant fire’. People addressed each other as ‘brothers in fragrant fire’. There is a clear indication to performing havans, acceptance of their impact and popularity in China. Introduction of Ayurveda to China Medicine in Bharat was a well-developed science and it reached China. Great Bharatiya acharyas translated medical texts and prescriptions from Sanskrit into Chinese. Acharya Dharmarksha edited and translated ‘Classic on Four Hundred and Four Diseases of Human Body’ and ‘Classic on the Path to Cultivation’. He also recorded the pathogenesis theory of Buddhist medicine. It was followed by number of other works including those compiled by Chinese Emperor Wu. The Bharatiya masters were welcomed because of their curing skills. China had developed its medical system and it could be benefited from the Bharatiya prescriptions extensively.  Wang Tao (670-755 AD) compiled ‘Important Secret Prescriptions’. During Sui and T’ang Dynasties many Bharatiya medical theories reached China. Chinese were impressed by the Bharatiya treatment of cataract extraction with needles often performed by non-Buddist monks. Poet Liu Yuxi even wrote a poem in praise of a doctor when he was treated for his eyes. Ayuvedic Texts on Medical Science Discovery of Sanskrit manuscripts called Bower Manuscripts from Kucha, now in the Chinese Xinjiang region opened up a new path of researches in Central Asia. It is a fifth century medical manuscript written on birch bark in Brahmi script in Sanskrit language. The second is on predicting future by dicing- Pashak Kevali  and the third is on remedy from snake bite- Mahamayuri-vidya-ragyi. Like Jivaka pustaka and Siddhasara Bower manuscript also plays an important role in researches on Chinese medicine. Astro-medicine was practiced in Bharat and travelled abroad. It is still practiced by Tibetan doctors. In the period of Northern Dynasty the Chinese Dharma Branch translated 20 volumes of Brahmana Astronomy. A volume in Book of the Sui Dynasty describes ten medical texts of Bharat including four volumes of Prescriptions by Nagarjuna, 23 volumes of ‘Medicinal Prescriptions of Fairies in the Western Regions’, One volume of Catalogue, ten volumes of ‘Medicinal Prescriptions of None Fairies of Fragrant Mountain’. China has preserved a long history of acceptance of Bharatiya prescriptions. Medicinal Value of Aromatic Plants-from Bharat to China Chinese medical science solicited Bharatiya supply of fragrant plants from very early times. Bharatiya Buddhist monks carrying aromatic plants and plant products were known as men of skills of curing and healing people from incurable and contagious diseases. Knowledge about aromatic plants reached China when Bharatiya medicinal texts were taken and translated over the centuries. They played an important role in development of Chinese medicine. It resulted in Bharatiya acharyas being revered as gurus and even worshiped a gods. In China saffron was used for medicines, flavoring and coloring during religious ceremonies. It could expel all foul odor, and get rid of impure air, and diseases in body. Itsing, a Chinese pilgrim to Bharat describes that haritaki grew mostly in the west, saffron grew in the north and the west abounded in asafetida. He has also recorded many fragrant medicines and cardamom. Kashmir was famous for dragon studhorses, saffron, fire balls and herbs. Law of Garuda The Bharatiya myth of Garuda was prevalent in China because of faith in its power of protecting from calamities and diseases. There is a chapter on the ‘Law of Garuda’ in a Buddhist text of Arya-manjushri-mulakalpa. It was popular in China for many centuries. One of the Chinese pilgrims, coming to Bharat in search of scripture, Itsing translated it. Dharmabhadra, an Bharatiya acharya of tenth century and several others also translated it. Garuda became a symbol in Chinese painting. One can see it painted in the Yonghe Palace temple in Beijing. Many Ming dynasty temples have also preserved this theme. The ruling elite liked to subsume the power of Garuda to strengthen the political authority. Presentation of Books on Prescriptions The Annals of Sui Dynasty mentions that a book entitled “Prescriptions of Bodhisattva Nagarjuna”, a text on astronomy and Bharatiya medicine were presented to the T’ang Emperor Xuangzong I in 719 AD by an envoy from Kapisha. A famous classic on Chinese medicine contains discourse on Bharatiya medical theories and prescriptions. It states that prescriptions given by Brahmanas were quite attractive for the Chinese. In 752 AD Wang Tao collected all the available prescriptions that were used till then. They were meant for curing diseases of ears and eyes, and could turn grey hair into black.  Annals of the Sung Dynasty are valuable to search Bharat’s contribution to Chinese science and technology. It was the time when contacts between Cholas and Sung China were at the peak. It has a chapter specifically on Cholas.  There are other books i.e. calendar by Gautama Siddhartha, a treatise written on pulse by Jivaka, sixty-four question & answers by him, a treatise on eye diseases, important prescriptions, and treatise on the entrails. This was a time of much interaction. Even Bharatiya games like throwing dice and others reached China.  Itsing has mentioned prescriptions to cure diseases like deafness and blindness using lotus herbal ointment. In some prescriptions, basil leaf, green cinnamon, and sweet gum are mentioned with other herbs. There is a lot of archival material to search and translate into Hindi and English to highlight Bharat’s contribution to contain epidemics and contagious diseases.

"HCARD, a robot, to assist frontline COVID-19 healthcare warriors", 28-Apr-2020,Umashankar Mishra,"Healthcare workers at hospitals are risking COVID-19 infection by taking care of those infected by it 24/7. Perhaps the level of risk may get reduced hereafter with the help of a new friend, HCARD. The robotic device HCARD, in short for Hospital Care Assistive Robotic Device, can help frontline healthcare workers in maintaining physical distance from those infected by coronavirus. HCARD is developed by Durgapur-based CSIR lab, Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute. The device is equipped with various state-of-the-art technologies and works both in automatic as well as manual modes of navigation. This robot can be controlled and monitored by a nursing booth with a control station having such features as navigation, drawer activation for providing medicines and food to patients, sample collection and audio-visual communication. Prof. (Dr.) Harish Hirani, Director, CSIR-CMERI stated that “This Hospital Care Assistive Robotic Device could be effective for frontline healthcare officials dealing with COVID-19 patients in delivering services while maintaining mandatory physical distancing”. The cost of this device is less than Rs 5 lakh and the weight is less than 80 kilograms, added Prof. Hirani. CSIR-CMERI is working on war footing to minimize the impact of COVID-19 through technological interventions. As spelled out by WHO, personal protective equipment (PPE) is very important in preventing transmission of coronavirus in the society, thus the Institute has channelized its resources optimally to develop PPE and community-level safety equipment for helping the public at large and healthcare institutions. Scientists at CMERI have also developed a few other customized technologies, including Disinfection Walkway, Road Sanitizer Unit, Face Mask, Mechanical Ventilator and Hospital Waste Management Facility.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/4/28/HCARD-a-robot-to-assist-frontline-COVID-19-healthcare-warriors.html

Another CSIR lab to start genome sequencing of novel coronavirus, 17-Apr-2020,Jyoti Singh,"After the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and the Institute of Genomic and Integrated Biology (IGIB), one more institute of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has started whole-genome sequencing of novel coronavirus. Chandigarh-based Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTech) has taken up the task of large-scale genome sequencing of the virus. Viruses have higher mutation rate compared to that of microbes and their genetic material keeps on changing quickly as they replicate rapidly. “These genome sequencing samples will be submitted to international recongised repository” said DrSanjeevKhosla, Director, IMTech while speaking with India Science Wire. The complete genome sequence information will enable researchers to gain insights about the origins of the virus, the different types of strains circulating in India and how it has spread across the length and breadth of our country. “The genomic resource obtained from this sequencing will also allow identification of new targets for diagnosis and drugs for COVID-19” said DrKhosla. Whole-genome sequencing is a method used to determine the complete DNA sequence of a specific organism’s genome.As the Institute is known for its specialization in microbial and genomic research, CSIR-IMTech will perform sequencing of the SARS-Cov-2 RNA genome isolated from clinical samples. So far, 9000 samples have been sequenced internationally as per Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) — a public platform started by the WHO in 2008 for countries to share genome sequences. The genomic resource obtained from this sequencing will also allow identification of new targets of diagnosis and drugs for COVID-19. Dr. SanjeevKhosla, Director, CSIR-IMTech, said, “We have already started clinical testing of samples and now by embarking on this mission to sequence viral strains, we will be better equipped to understand the nature of this virus, which has caused a global pandemic.” CSIR-IMTech will be using its experience in portable, real-time and direct genome sequencing to study the chemical modification in SARS-Cov-2 strains from India.

Innovations by Indians during the COVID-19 Pandemic, 23-Apr-2020,,"From manufacturing masks and sanitisers to making of disinfected chambers to combat COVID-19, The indomitable spirit of man has not, however, failed to surface. Inventing a cure to COVID-19 has been engaging man's mind ever since the deadly virus came, this pandemic has lead to many innovations to tackle the  A disinfected barrier-examination booth for examining  Besides floating the possible theories, world powers hardly have the time to prove or disprove any, every country's hands being full with having to address the question of saving their people and economy from the deadly viral attack. While a permanent cure is hopefully on the anvil, humankind has to make do for the present with innovative solutions to the underlying problem of survival. India has been grappling hard with the challenge of saving lives, treating the afflicted people through isolation and quarantine, preventing the contracting of the virus by more people, and the elimination of the virus altogether. The multiple tasks constitute a formidable exercise in the face of the country's vast landmass, demography and unique religious and cultural constraints. For instance, the authorities had to do a lot of persuading to convince some sections of people against collecting on the roads or places of worship. The lockdown has nothing to do with the fundamental right to practise a religion of one's choice as per the established traditions and customs. The Union government has been leaving no stone unturned to create awareness among the people to comply with the lockdown and maintain social distancing. Besides, it is counting on the cooperation of the citizens and has calibrated its measures and methods of fighting the virus accordingly.] What makes the situation particularly vulnerable is the need to divert much of the available resources to address the various aspects of this emergency operation even when the economy has already been on a downslide. In the circumstances, much depends on the private sector and the public to come up with solutions for the humongous task on hand. We are long past the stage of leaving the issue to doctors, nurses and cleaning staff. Hence, the Prime Minister's call to the people of the nation from all walks of life to be united in humanity's war on the virus. A Centre for Augmenting War with COVID-19 Health Crisis (CAWACH) has been constituted by the Department of Science and Technology for Rs 56 crore to scout, evaluate and support innovations and start-ups that address COVID-19 challenges. The National Innovation Foundation (NIF), under the Department of Science & Technology, has welcomed innovative solutions and is committed to funding citizens who find COVID-19 related solutions and scaling up the innovations. In real terms on the ground level, instead of lamenting over the non-availability or the cost factor of facial masks or hand sanitiser, people have been coming up with ingenious ideas of fashioning home-made masks and sanitisers from material and resources readily available. Neem leaves, turmeric and the wide variety of spices that find a pride of place in a standard Indian kitchen shelf have been put to good use to prepare sanitisers and concoctions, as well as food preparations fit enough to build up one's immunity. Cow dung, known for its anti-septic value, and cow urine do not lag far behind. However, their external or internal use is taken with a generous pinch of cynicism and skepticism except by hardcore votaries of the ancient Sanatana Dharmic traditions and customs. Meanwhile, there are cities and towns in India, although few, like Bengaluru, where well-informed people living in multi-storied buildings, use a straightforward and innovative means to avoidtouching buttons in elevators – toothpicks exclusively kept for the purpose.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/4/23/Innovations-by-Indians-during-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-.html

India to be self-reliant in RT-PCR and Antibody test kits by the end of next month: Dr Harsh Vardhan, 29-Apr-2020,,"Union Minister of Science & Technology, Health & Family Welfare and Earth Sciences, Dr Harsh Vardhan, on April 28, reviewed, through video-conferencing, the various initiatives undertaken by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and its Autonomous Institutes and its Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) – BIRAC and BIBCOL, to tackle the current COVID-19 crisis especially with respect to progress made in indigenous development of vaccine, Rapid Test and RT-PCR diagnostic Kits. Secretary, DBT, Dr. Renu Swarup informed that DBT has evolved a multi-pronged research strategy and action plan for immediate response as well as for long-term preparedness to tackle COVID-19. These multifaceted efforts include research towards development of candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and suitable animal models for COVID-19 as well as development of indigenous diagnostics and genomic studies on the host and pathogen. The DBT and its PSU, Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) has announced a COVID-19 Research Consortium Call to support Diagnostics, Vaccines, Novel Therapeutics, Repurposing of Drugs or any other intervention for control of COVID-19. During interaction with DBT scientists, Union Minister was informed about various computational methods being developed by DBT labs/Autonomous Institutes to predict potential antiviral drug molecules. In another strategy, surrogates of the virus are being developed representing one or more critical steps in virus lifecycle and inhibitors are being tested. Work is in progress to isolate neutralizing antibodies either from the patients recovered from COVID-19 or from human antibody libraries. Also various Autonomous Institutes of DBT are working on development of candidate vaccines which are at various stages of pre-clinical studies with an overall aim to demonstrate the proof of concept and immunogenicity and safety evaluation prior to clinical testing. At the moment, at least 9 of these studies are in early stages and one delivery and adjuvant system for improving the immunogenicity of candidate vaccine is at the advanced stage of development. While discussing genetic sequencing, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said, “These genetic sequencing efforts remind me of Polio eradication movement 26 years back. Towards the fag end of the Polio movement, active surveillance of the country was done to find out the cases of acute flaccid paralysis. That time also, genetic sequencing was used to establish the travel history of polio virus which eventually helped in the eradication of polio.” After the presentation, Dr. Harsh Vardhan appreciated the work being done by scientists and their innovative ways of finding solutions to mitigate COVID-19. “The sincere efforts of DBT scientists will enable the country to be self-reliant in production of RT-PCR and Antibody test kits by the end of next month. This will make it possible to meet the target of conducting one lakh tests per day by the end of next month”, he said. He also exhorted scientists working on developing new vaccines, new drugs and medical equipment, to speed up their work. “Out of at least half a dozen candidates supported for vaccines, four are in an advanced stage and regulatory platform at one place has been constituted for speedy clearances”, he said. Dr. Harsh Vardhan also appreciated the BIRAC efforts in supporting over 150 startup solutions of which over 20 are ready for deployment.He also released a Hand-Sanitizer developed by another PSU of DBT, Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Corporation Ltd. (BIBCOL) which is engaged in manufacturing of various biological, pharmaceutical and food products. It currently is manufacturing formulations of Vitamin C and Zinc tablets to contribute towards the solutions for COVID-19. “A contribution of Rupee One towards commercial sale of each single bottle of this Sanitizer will go to PM Cares Fund”, Dr. Harsh Vardhan said. Dr. Renu Swarup, Secretary, DBT, senior officials, Directors of DBT-Autonomous Institutes, Senior Scientists and senior officials from BIRAC and BIBCOL participated in the meeting.(India Science Wire)",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/4/29/Dr-Harsh-Vardhan.html
Essential oil-based vapouriser can help in alleviating respiratory distress, 04-May-2020,,"Umashankar Mishra The Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP) has launched a scientific knowledge-based essential oil vapouriser concentrate formulation called CIM-RespCool. It could be helpful in the management of respiratory distress caused by environmental containments including viruses, said scientists at CIMAP. In addition to sanitizing a specific area, CIM-RespCool also provides pleasant smell. Essential oils like Mentha, Rosemary, and Basil have been used to develop the formulation. The product is safe and can be used in a diffuser (any type) at home, office, hospital, etc. CIM-RespCool has been launched on this Friday, by Dr Prabodh K. Trivedi, Director of CSIR-CIMAP. The Lucknow-based CSIR-CIMAP is a frontier plant research laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The product has been developed by a team of scientists at CSIR-CIMAP, led by Dr. Ajit K. Shasany. This formulation has the ability to manage not only a broad spectrum of microbes, but also environmental contaminants including viruses. The formulation has been handed over to Dr. M. L. B. Bhatt, Vice-Chancellor, KGM University, Lucknow, by Dr Prabodh K Trivedi for evaluation in the wards. Essential oils-based formulations are commonly used in aromatherapy. They are either inhaled from a vapouriser/humidifier or rubbed on the skin as a liquid. Most of the available microbial management vapouriser products contain synthetic chemicals and may be allergic to some people and, therefore, cannot be used regularly. However, the acceptance of natural essential oil-based products is quite high as compared to pure molecule-based synthetic products.

Tata Sons to Scale-up Covid-19 Testing Kit ‘Feluda’, 09-May-2020,Umashankar Mishra,"The Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), Delhi, has transferred the technology Feluda (FNCAS9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay) to Tata Sons for further development and commercialisation. A memorandum of understanding reflecting the arrangement has been signed between the two institutions. Feluda is a rapid diagnostic kit for COVID-19, developed indigenously by IGIB, a CSIR institution. The main advantages of Feluda are its affordability, relative ease of use and non-dependency on expensive Q-PCR machines.“Innovative ‘Feluda’ test uses cutting-edge Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology for detection of genomic sequence of novel coronavirus. It uses a test protocol that is simple to administer and easy to interpret enabling results to be made available to the medical fraternity in relatively lesser time, as compared to other test protocols”, said BanmaliAgrawala, President - Infrastructure and Defence & Aerospace, Tata Sons. Dr. Anurag Agrawal, Director-IGIB highlighted that the technology was conceived and developed at CSIR IGIB under sickle cell mission and utilizes an indigenously developed cutting edge CRISPR Cas9 technology to specifically recognize COVID-19 sequence in a sample. A combination of CRISPR biology and paper-strip chemistry leads to a visible signal readout on a paper strip that can be rapidly assessed for establishing the presence of viral infection in a sample. “CSIR labs such as CSIR-IGIB have been working on deep science and developing cutting-edge technology and I am happy to see that a leading industrygroup the TataSons is partnering towards its deployment. The strong partnership with industry in tackling COVID-19 has been the hallmark of CSIR’s strategy in mitigation of COVID-19”, said Dr. Shekhar C. Mande, DG-CSIR. “We are happy to have a partnership with the CSIRfor further development and commercialisation of the technology for COVID-19 detection. We believe that CRISPR is futuristic technology that can also be configured for detection of multiple other pathogens in the future,” added Agrawala.

IIT Delhi start-up launches ‘Reusable Antimicrobial Mask’, 07-May-2020,,"The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered acute shortage of face masks in the country. Face mask is considered as an important tool to contain transmission of coronavirus from one person to another. Now that every individual has been mandated to use a face mask regularly, single-use mask is not a cost-effective solution for everyone. An IIT Delhi start-up ""Nanosafe Solutions"" has launched an antimicrobial and washable face mask ""NSafe"", which is reusable up to 50 launderings, thus greatly cutting down the cost of use. The team consists of Dr. Anasuya Roy, an IIT Delhi Alumnus, Founder and CEO of Nanosafe Solutions Pvt. Ltd., and Prof. Mangala Joshi, Department of Textile and Fibre Engineering, IIT Delhi, and also Founder and Director of the start-up. NSafe mask is a highly engineered triple-layered product consisting of an inner hydrophilic layer for comfort, a middle layer having antimicrobial activity and the outermost layer that repels water and oil NSafe mask has 99.2% bacterial filtration efficiency (at 3 microns) and complies with ASTM standards of breathability and splash resistance. The mask is extremely comfortable and breathable. Elastic band in the chin region and wire in the nose region provide adequate fit of the mask to the wearer. Prof. Mangala Joshi, Department of Textile and Fibre Engineering, IIT Delhi, said, “We believe this is the first fabric-based antimicrobial face mask launched in India, which is washable and reusable. This mask has very high bacterial filtration efficiency and conforms to ASTM standards. It is engineered to have very good breathability and comfort.” Dr. Anasuya Roy, Founder and CEO of Nanosafe Solutions added, “The mask has been designed to maximize durability and dimensional stability, so that the mask can be reused 50 times. Effective reusability is an important factor as single-use masks will cause huge disposal issues”. NSafe mask enhances protection to the wearer through three different mechanisms: mechanical filtration, antimicrobial decontamination and repulsion of aerosol droplets. NSafe masks are dry-cleaned before packaging and packaged under hygienic conditions. After each usage (approximately 8-9 hours), the mask has to be handwashed in cold water with mild detergent and dried thoroughly in the sunlight. After 50 usages, the mask has to be disposed of in a sealed polyethylene bag and put in the recyclable waste bin. NSafe mask is a premium product that is likely to be available at MRP of Rs. 299 (Pack of 2) and Rs. 589 (Pack of 4). The start-up has started manufacturing the masks.

Nation’s Science & Tech institutions raise their game against COVID-19! India’s prestigious S&T agencies and their efforts to combat Coronavirus pandemic, 06-Apr-2020,Jyoti Sharma/ S.K. Varshney,"COVID-19, also known as coronavirus, is making people all over the world go helter-skelter and clueless. As per ‘worldometer’, over one million people have already fallen prey to this virus as of writing this and the numbers are increasing thick and fast. Over 59,000 people have succumbed to death and still counting. In India, it has affected over 3000 people and has witnessed about 60 deaths so far. The World Health Organization (WHO) has pooled in resources and scientists from across the world in its search for a potential vaccine. India is also playing a big role in this at WHO. In addition, thousands of researchers around the world are offering their expertise, time and help through international platforms such as Crowdfight COVID-19 to fight against COVID-19. Researchers are also connecting through social media apps such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn to provide their services voluntarily. With no vaccine in sight for at least the next 12-18 months, it seems the fight for rescuing humankind from this deadly virus has only just begun. With no real global consensus on the response mechanism, each nation is left to fend for itself when it comes protecting its own citizens. India’s quick response With over 1.3 billion people in Her bosom, the spread of coronavirus in India and India’s response mechanisms are being closely watched over by the rest of the world. Led by the Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, India is battling this virus with all its might. Invoking the Disaster Management Act of 2015, India announced a complete lockdown on 25 March for a period of 21 days. The early announcement of a lockdown, when the infected count was less than 400, was well appreciated by WHO. Setting up of a COVID-19 Task Force and announcement of a series of ‘social distancing’ and other serious measures followed suit. A few such important measures are listed below. -	Started tracing contacts of COVID-affected people. -	Suspended all existing visas (except diplomatic, official, UN/international organisations, employment, project visas). -	Suspended international and domestic flights, trains and bus services until April 15. -	Initiated economic measures targeting the poor so that none goes hungry during this period.  -	Converted the coaches of Indian Railways as isolation wards. R&D Institutions Taking Up The Challenge While India's pro-active, pre-emptive, and a ‘whole government’ approach to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic is happening on one side, the slowdown in trade between India and the rest of the world works as counter-productive on the other side. This slowdown in trade is disrupting the supply chains of many essential commodities needed for the fight. The list of such essential commodities includes COVID-19 testing kits, masks, alcohol-based sanitizers, personal protective equipment (PPEs), dress materials for frontline health workers, ventilators (breathing devices) for patients, etc. The challenge is to produce these as quickly as possible and in bulk. This situation prompted the Government of India to vigorously activate the ‘Make in India’ Programme, and involved various Research & Development (R&D)institutions of the country. Under the leadership of Dr Harsha Vardhan, Hon’ble Minister for Health, Science and Technology, and Earth Sciences, a well-coordinated approach has been adopted to activate the scientific community of the country. This approach has helped in providing a common platform for sharing of best practices, collaboration of work, development of need-based innovations, and in avoiding duplication of research work. To cut it short, in such a short period of time, India was able to put thousands of researchers in the country to work round the clock to develop new testing kits, protective equipment, respiratory devices, etc. India’s apex S&T agency and its efforts Department of Science and Technology (DST) is India’s apex science and technology (S&T) agency. With the help of institutions under DST and sister ministries, DST is taking the lead in coordinating the effort to map and upscale appropriate technologies in India for addressing a plethora of issues related to COVID-19. It is also scouting for solutions that are more relevant to the country and also to help prepare the country for exigencies arising out of COVID-19 pandemic. DST through its autonomous institutions and statutory bodies has instituted three ways to fight COVID-19: a)	extensive mapping of solutions requiring R&D support, startups with viable products requiring facilitation and manufacturing support; b)	identification of market deployable products requiring seed support; and  c)	support for solutions already in the market but requiring substantial scale-up to augment their manufacturing infrastructure and capabilities. Intensification of Research in High Priority Area (IRPHA) Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) is an autonomous body under DST. Under its Intensification of Research in High Priority Area (IRPHA) scheme, SERB had invited competitive proposals having a strong interdisciplinary component to ramp up national R&D efforts for epidemiological studies, studies on immune response and immunity during respiratory viral infections, new anti-virals, vaccines, and affordable diagnostic against COVID-19 and related respiratory viral infections. Apart from this, SERB also invited short-term ‘Core Research Grant Special Call on COVID-19’ to meet the current requirements of the health workers such as (a) affordable and portable rapid diagnostic kits or tools, (b)computational identification and validation of COVID-19 molecular targets, and (c) drug repurposing against key COVID-19 targets and in-vitro/clinical dose testing of nutritional supplements for immunity. The first set of five projects has been selected by SERB, which will be supported for further development into implementable technologies. Three of these projects concern the highly important issue of antiviral and virustatic surface coating of inanimate surfaces, such as personal protection equipment (PPE); the fourth one deals with the identification of metabolite biomarkers in COVID-19 infected patients enabling therapeutic target identification; and the last one concerns with the development of antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein of coronavirus. Tracking and trailing the virus through a data-driven approach is an important step to contain its spread. In this direction, SERB has announced short-term project on mathematical modeling of COVID-19 spread; statistical machine learning, forecasting and inferences from pandemic data; focused algorithms for infectious disease modeling and quantitative social science approaches for epidemiological models. In the absence of preventive and curable measures, mathematical models may help in assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Research Proposals Invited By TDB The Technology Development Board (TDB), a statutory body under DST, has invited proposals from Indian companies and enterprises to address protection and home-based respiratory interventions for COVID 19 patients. Industries may help in this crucial condition to provide need-based indigenously developed/imported technologically and innovative solutions like low-cost masks, cost-effective thermal scanning devices, technologies for sanitization of large areas as well as for contactless entry, rapid diagnostic kits and oxygenators, and ventilators. Artificial manual breathing unit (AMBU) Sri Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Science and Technology (SCTIMST), Trivandrum, has developed a ventilator system based on an artificial manual breathing unit (AMBU). The institute’s automated AMBU ventilator with inputs from clinical faculty will assist in the breathing of the critical patients who have no access to ICU ventilators. The technology has rapidly moved into clinical trials and manufacturing through Wipro3D, Bangalore. Apart from this emergency ventilator, the Institute is also making efforts in developing low-cost AI-enabled digital X-ray detectors for screening COVID-19 patients. Anti-microbial coating The Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), an autonomous institution under DST, has come up with a one-step curable anti-microbial coating. This coating is capable of completely killing the influenza virus and resistant pathogenic bacteria and fungi, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, fluconazole-resistant C. albicans spp. and a range of virus type Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-19). It is anticipated that the coating will not allow microorganisms to become active on coated surfaces. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the coating may be used to protect personal protective tools, clothes and equipment of health workers. Grassroots Innovations The National Innovation Foundation (NSF), another autonomous institution of DST encourages and supports grassroots innovations developed by individuals and local communities in any technological field.NSF has invited citizens to come up with creative and innovative ideas through its ‘Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3)’ for tackling the following issues: (a) healthy food for nutrition and boosting immunity; (b) reducing transmission of coronavirus; (c) sanitising one's hands, body, home items and home, public places wherever required; (d) supply and distribution of essential items to people, especially the elderly living alone; (e) gainful engagement of people at home; (f) PPEs andrapid diagnostic testing facilities for capacity building of healthcare; and (g) rethinking ""contactless"" devices for post-corona implementation needs and varying needs of the different segment of the population during COVID-19. Besides inculcating scientific temperament among masses, this initiative will also encourage them to participate actively in the government’s programmes against the pandemic. Synergizing S&T efforts As mentioned earlier, the Government of India has set up a ‘COVID-19 Task Force’ for mapping the COVID-19 related technology capabilities in start-ups, academia, research and development labs and industry. The capacity mapping group consists of representatives from DST, Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEIT), Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Startup India and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). This Task Force has identified over 500 entities in the areas of diagnostics, drugs, ventilators, protection gear, disinfecting systems, etc. The solutions identified include masks and other protective gear, sanitizers, affordable kits for screening, ventilators and oxygenators, data analytics for tracking, monitoring, and controlling the spread of outbreak through AI and IoT-based solutions, to name a few. The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), a sister department of DST,have also announced COVID-19 Research Consortium Program and are seeking proposals from industry, academia, industry-academia partnership with a focus on affordable diagnostics, vaccines, novel therapeutics, repurposing of drugs or any other intervention for control of COVID-19. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), under its New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI), is also seeking proposals from industries for effective containment interventions, assistive devices such as affordable ventilators, innovative diagnostics (rapid, affordable, cutting edge), novel drugs or repurposed drugs, new vaccines or repurposed vaccine, and track-and-trace technologies. Other innovative, rapid and economic solutions are also coming from other institutions. For instance, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) has developed a paper strip-based testing assay. This testing assay can detect the viral RNA of the novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 within an hour. Many research groups are focussing on basic science and other social aspects of this pandemic like virus morphogenesis & development, sequencing of local strain, virus-host interaction, genetic variants linked with virulence, evolution and transmission pattern, pathogenesis studies and collection of epidemiological data. These studies are very much necessary for development of vaccines and therapeutic drugs against COVID-19. S&T at private labs Efforts and contributions from private players have indeed accelerated the process of the development of diagnostics, vaccines and novel therapeutics. A Pune-based molecular diagnostics company, Mylab Discovery Solutions, has developed the first COVID-19 rapid testing kit in India. This testing kit has been approved by the Indian Food and Drug Administration, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), and the ICMR.  This kit can give test results within 2.5 hours.  After joining hands with Serum Institute of India and AP Globale, the test capacity of Mylab has increased from 1.5 lakh tests a week to 20 lakh (2 million) tests a week. An incubate company of the Pune-based Science and Technology Park (STP or Scitech Park) has come up with an innovative anti-COVID-19 solution through a product called ‘Scitech Airon’ under the ‘Nidhi Prayas’ programme of DST. The start-up claimed that the ionizer machine generates negatively charged ions at approximately a hundred million per 8 seconds (10 ions per sec). This machine has the potential to reduce the viral load within a room by 99.7 per cent (based on room size). This can be of good help to sanitise the quarantine facilities and hospitals. Along with technological and medical solutions, preparation of science-based IEC (information, educational and communication) material and disseminating the same to the larger public also form an important task. Such IEC material can dispel the myth, panic, and psychological stress being faced by the public. One such government-led AI-based app called ‘Corona Kavach’ was developed in that direction. Other similar tracking apps are also available to alert users when they come in the proximity of a confirmed coronavirus positive person. However, these apps have not gained enough traction among the public so far. Comprehensive efforts at war foot The Government of India is fully committed to facilitating Indian health and scientific community in the fight against COVID-19. The government scientific agencies are not leaving any stones unturned in order to provide full support to the community, researchers, private and public research labs, start-ups, incubators, entrepreneurs and industries. Funding agencies are making an effort to link national projects with global projects to share the expertise among nations, avoid duplication and speed up the entire process when and where required. On 21 March, Indian scientists were given access to collect blood, nasal and throat samples from COVID-19-infected people through a memorandum issued by the government’s Empowered Committee on COVID-19. This announcement has spurred several research projects related to the sequencing of local COVID-19 strain, the development of diagnostic kits, vaccine and so on. Furthermore, the government allows all national research laboratories including those under CSIR, DBT, DST and Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) to carry out COVID-19 testing. This will help to speed up the screening process and fasten tracing of contacts. On 3 April, DST has set up a ‘Centre for Augmenting WAR with COVID-19 Health Crisis’ (CAWACH) at a total cost of Rs 56 Cr to evaluate and support up to 50 innovations and start-ups that address COVID-19 challenges. CAWACH is set up in the Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE), a technology business incubator at IIT Bombay. Supported by DST, CAWACH will provide timely support at different stages for fast-tracking the commercialization process and scale-up of technologies across the country. The Government of India firmly believes that these R&D initiatives will certainly help the country in overcoming the pandemic in the not-too-distant future.

New project to develop human monoclonal antibodies for neutralising Coronavirus, 10-May-2020,Umashankar Mishra,"The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), through its New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) program, has approved a project towards the development of human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in patients. This project on generation of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies as a therapeutic strategy will be implemented by a multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary team. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a form of immunotherapy designed to produce immunity to a disease or to enhance resistance by the immune system. This new project aims to generate hmAbsto SARS-CoV-2 from gradual recovery phase of COVID-19 patients and select high affinity and neutralizing antibodies. The project also aims to anticipate future adaptation of the virus and generate hmAbs clones that can neutralize the mutated virus so that could be readily used for combating future SARS-CoV infections. This industry-academiacollaborationcomprisesNational Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) Pune; Indian Institute of Technology(IIT),Indore;PredOmixTechnologies Ltd,Gurugram;and Bharat Biotech International Ltd (BBIL),Hyderabad. Vaccines and biotherapeutics maker BBILis leading the project to develop human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) for COVID-19 infection. BBIL will be the commercial partner and responsible for subsequent development and commercialization of the hmAbs generated. DG-CSIR, Dr Shekhar C Mande commented that “As the research into SARS-CoV-2 is in early days and our understanding is evolving each day, it is critical that we deploy all possible strategies to combat the virus. Hence, CSIR is exploring all avenues and we are supporting new ideas which have clear deployment strategy”. CSIR is leading the fight against COVID-19 using multi-pronged approach and multiple models of engagement. CSIR labs themselves are developing technologies and products and are working with industry and public sector undertakings for deployment. NMITLI is a flagship program of CSIR aimed to support new ideas and projects from academic institutions and industries.

S&T based innovative solutions by common people participating in NIF’s Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3) ready to make a difference, 18-May-2020,,"The National Innovation Foundation – India (NIF), an autonomous body of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) has identified several S&T based innovative solutions through the Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3), a campaign which was running from 31st March to 10th May 2020 for engaging innovative citizens to come up with ideas and innovations to tackle the pandemic. NIF is providing incubation and mentoring support for further dissemination to the generator of the ideas. A foot-operated device for hand sanitization and washing and an innovative sprayer for sanitization are the two recently supported innovations under the campaign. Shri Mupparapu Raju from Warrangal, Telangana, has designed the foot-operated device for hand sanitization and washing, which is a timely solution in response to need for contactless devices in the prevailing COVID-19 environment. It facilitates dispensing of soap and water by way of operating the device by foot, and not hands. As a result, there is no hand-related contact between the user and sanitizer, soap, or water, which are adequately stored in separate containers as a part of the device. Shri Raju has implemented the device at various locations (Warrangal, Mahabubabad, and others) in the State of Telangana. NIF has extended support to the innovator for value addition and in meeting the production commitments.

Implementation of Foot-operated device for Hand Sanitization and Washing at Warangal and Mahabubabad districts of Telangana. The other supported innovation is an innovative sprayer capable of sanitizing or washing large areas like roads, societies, doors, compounds, walls, etc. The sprayer consists of two radial fans of aluminum moving opposite to each other. In terms of mechanism, each fan sucks air from two opposite directions, which is released through nozzles at high pressure with minute droplets sizes. As the panel rotates 180 degrees, it can cover from the ground upto 15 feet tall walls. Any tractor of power more than 15 horsepower(hp) can be used to operate this through Power Take-Off (PTO). By deploying this sprayer, one can sanitize the societies, roads, and so on at a maximum distance of 30 feet from the center of machine and upto 15 feet height. Which means the machine will sanitise 30 feet horizontally and 15 feet vertically. As a result, compounds, doors can easily be sanitized with this sprayer. Nozzles in the sprayer are such that during operation of the device, the required area can be sanitized at ease, be it a spacious location or a congested location. ""Unleashing the partnership, ownership and creativity potential of our citizens in COVID-19 solutions and actions is a huge opportunity which is made visible by the NIF challenge. This is empowering our grass-roots innovators and entrepreneurs by recognition, prototyping help and thus translation of their relevant ideas into products."", said Prof Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST. A large number of citizens have participated in the Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3) and helping the country come out of this crisis through Science and Technology based innovative solutions. The relevance of technologies to COVID-19 and the pace at which these have been designed, prototyped and eventually made available for social and commercial dissemination establishes the fact that Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3) of NIF has been accepted very well by common people who believe that Innovation can indeed help the nation conquer crisis.

WHO resumes hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine trials, 06-Jun-2020,,"Jyoti Singh World Health Organisation (WHO) has decided to resume hydroxychloroquineand chloroquine (HCQ/CQ) trails after Indian scientists have questioned its earlier decision to halt it temporarily. WHO had stopped the trails based on a study published in the journal Lancet. This news has received overwhelming response from all spheres. “We're happy that the WHO resumed trials of hydroxychloroquine. I firmly believe that the WHO's decision was taken in haste. It was a kind of knee-jerk reaction. They should have analysed the data on their own before temporarily suspending trials” said Shekhar C Mande, Director General, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). “I think that HCQ/CQ trails are of global importance and I am glad to see them resumed,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, Director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), while speaking with India Science Wire. Dr Mande, Dr Agrawal (IGIB), and Dr RajeevaKarandikar from the Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI) have written a joint letter to the WHO’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan, where they have pointed out several limitations in the study as the authors have themselves acknowledged it in the article. “This study is highly flawed and should not be used to judge CQ/HCQ effectiveness or toxicity. A high quality RCT is needed,” tweeted Dr Agarwal. The scientists have stated in the letter that the Lancet article represents an observational study. Unlike randomized blinded trails where subjects are chosen randomly to receive a treatment to minimize differences between treatment groups, this study does not any such prior design. They have also pointed out that the methodology of the paper mentions that all patients who were hospitalized between 20 December 2019 and 14 April 2020 with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infections were analysed. “Whereas, the first reported symptoms of the diseases as cluster of cases of pneumonia were recorded on 31 December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It was only on 5 January 2020 that WHO published the first disease outbreak news on the new virus. It was only on 20 January 2020 that the first case was recorded in the United States of America. Thus, scanning the records of hospitalisation from 20 December 2019 appears to be unjustified,” said the letter. It is mentioned in the letter that while it is not expected to make any difference since PCR confirmation would not be there for non-COVID-19 cases. It is worth noting that the number of patients and the number of deaths in this study are inconsistent with public health records of the same, often exceeding them despite surveying only a subset of healthcare organisations. This raises the concern for errors in data extraction from electronic records. Even if the data were correctly extracted, severe flaws remain.

"Coro-robot serves food, water and medicines to COVID-19 Patients in Thane", 07-Jun-2020,,"“I wanted to make this robot basically for our ward-boys and nurses who are at the forefront of treating corona patients” Ward boys, nurses are the frontline Corona warriors in our society who probably come into contact with Covid positive patients for many times and for the longest duration. It is with a noble thought of helping these warriors that Pratik Tirodkar, an Instrumentation engineer from Thane came out with the idea of developing a robot which would dispense food, water and medicines to corona patients in their wards without necessity of physical presence of nurses and other care-givers. Pratik made “Coro-bot”, inspired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Make in India and his clarion call for innovation. Coro-bot cuts away the requirement of physical contact of nurses and ward boys with the patient. It delivers food, water, medicines to them. It can interact with them by using camera. Patients are cautioned through audio reminders to sanitise their hands before they pick up things from trays. The robot has 3 trays which can store various things. The censors in dispensers ensure that liquids or sanitisers flow quickly when we hold our hand below it and flow is cut-off when the hand/glass is removed from underneath the dispensing area. This not only provides ease but also ensures minimal wastage. Robot has illumination facility using LED lights which makes sure that it can be easily used during night as well. It also has small PC like set-up at top for computer work and entertainment. Coro-bot not only allows sanitisation by users but it also sanitises itself to avoid spreading of viruses through touching of its surfaces. It has 3 nozzles at the back to spray disinfectant on itself. Moreover, it goes on sanitising the path it treads by using UV lights which do the primary sanitising of its path. It has 3 trays which can carry 10-15 kg weight each and storage at the bottom has 30 kg capacity. Hence it can easily carry supplies for 10-15 people at a time. “I wanted to make this robot basically for our ward-boys and nurses who are at the forefront of treating corona patients’. But due to lockdown it became difficult to procure necessary material for the same. During this period, I got the timely help from Member of Parliament from Kalyan constituency Shri Shrikant Shinde. I along with team of my 3-4 employees made customizable components as many regular parts were not available due to lockdown. When we will get some components in Unlock1 we will improve the appearance of the robots”, said Pratik while speaking to PIB. Pratik informs, that his unit has capacity to make 2-3 robots per week, however the prototype just took 15-20 days to be made. Currently it is being  used at Holycross Hospital in Kalyan. Pratik and his team have created a special app for operating this robot due to which now it can be operated from far away places as well. Internet of Things (IoT) will be used for this process. IoT is the same process which is behind automation of home appliances which is popularly known as smart homes. With young enthusiasts like Pratik around, India is not far from its dream of becoming Aatmanirbhar Bharat.

Efforts to teach sanitisation techniques to homeless and migrants, 16-Jun-2020,Umashankar Mishra,"The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI) has joined hands with the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA), Nagpur, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to impart training to homeless and migrant labourers staying in Nagpur. Dr. Pratap Reddy Maddigapu, Project Scientist at the CSIR-NEERI, stated that a disinfection device based on Ultraviolet (UV)-C technology can be used to disinfect used masks, used hand gloves, papers, documents, files, etc. Homeless and migrant labourers, after giving them proper training, can be engaged in such disinfection activities for their livelihood, he added. A meeting in this regard was held recently at CSIR-NEERI in the presence of Justice Abhijeet Deshmukh, Secretary, DLSA, and Dr. Rakesh Kumar, Director, CSIR-NEERI. During the discussion, the participants emphasized that before the schools, colleges, hotels, etc. are reopened, all these institutions should be properly sanitized amid various unlocking phases, as many schools, especially government and Zilla Parishad schools, have been used to quarantine COVID-19 suspects and shelter migrant workers. Representatives from DLSA and NGOs pointed out that various government and private organizations will henceforth seek routine and standard environmental sanitization procedures, where CSIR-NEERI could play a major role in bringing out a policy document. CSIR-NEERI could also be instrumental in imparting sanitization training to homeless and migrant labourers for providing them employment opportunities. CSIR-NEERI agreed to work with DLSA and NGOs for the betterment of homeless and migrant labourers, not only with respect to sanitization techniques but also for various environmental aspects having employment potential. Dr. Rakesh Kumar reiterated that an effective policy should be formulated for cleaning and disinfection of various places, wherever required. He emphasized on the need to bring out training material in three languages, i.e. English, Marathi, and Hindi. Dr. Suvha Lama, Scientist, CSIR-NEERI, explained on how to clean and disinfect the workplaces. Dr. Shilpa Kumari, Scientist, CSIR-NEERI, informed that the institution had already imparted training to various NGOs on preparing reusable masks according to WHO guidelines.

New mobile lab launched to expand COVID-19 testing in remote areas, 19-Jun-2020,Umashankar Mishra,"Amidst ever-increasing cases of coronavirus, efforts are being made to speed up the testing of suspects of COVID-19 carriers, especially in the interior parts of the country. In one such initiative, a mobile diagnostic unit I-Lab (Infectious disease diagnostic lab) has been launched on Thursday by Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Minister of Science and Technology, Health and Family Welfare and Earth Sciences. The I-Lab is expected to help in the expansion of COVID-19 testing in remote areas. I-lab is a Biosafety Level (BSL)-2 facility with on-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RT-PCR, and Biochemistry analysers. It can run 50 RT-PCR reactions and about 200 ELISA in a day. Double set of machines can help increase the capacity to about 500 per day in 8 hours shift, said Dr. Harsh Vardhan. A unique feature of this mobile testing lab is its utility in diagnosing other infectious diseases beyond the COVID-19 period. Additional test for other diseases for TB, HIV, etc. will be priced as per CGHS rates. These labs will be provided to the regional/city hubs and they will deploy them further in the interior, inaccessible parts of the region. I-Lab, the first lab of its kind in the country, has been developed jointly by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the Andhra Pradesh Med-tech Zone (AMTZ), Asia's first medical equipment manufacturing ecosystem. DBT and AMTZ have initiated the DBT-AMTZ COMManD (COVID Medtech Manufacturing Development) Consortia to address the shortage of critical healthcare technologies in India and move progressively towards a stage of self-sufficiency. Under this Consortia, India’s first I-lab (infectious disease diagnostic lab) has been built at AMTZ in record time of 8 days from the date of receipt of Automotive Chassis, from Bharat Benz. This mobile unit can be deployed in remote areas and can be lifted from Automotive Chassis and can be put on goods train for sending it to any location in the country. The BSL-2 Lab is as per the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) specification and is being attached to DBT’s certified testing centres.

"COVID-19 serves as a clarion call to achieve Atmanirbhar Bharat, says Dr Raghunath Mashelkar", 02-Jul-2020,Jyoti Singh,"COVID-19 has brought in to the country a clarion call for everyone to rebuild, recover, and re-imagine ourselves in order to achieve Atmanirbhar Bharat, said Padma Vibhushan, Dr RaghunathAnantMashelkar. He was delivering a talk on “Building Atmanirbhar Bharat with Atmabishwas” under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-Summer Research Training Programme (CSIR-SRTP), 2020, programme coordinated by the North East Institute of Science and Technology (CSIR-NEIST). Dr Mashelkar said that in our endeavour to attain self-reliance or Atmanirbhar Bharat, we cannot isolate ourselves from the world but integrate with global supply chain. He emphasized on five pillars of ‘atmanirbharata’ – Buy, Make, Buy to make better, Make to buy better, and Make it together (building public-private partnerships). He said that he has unequivocal confidence in the youth power of the country, which needs to be harnessed with a back-up of technology and trust, for our country to flourish. Dr Mashelkarwas of the view that the ‘Make in India’ initiative should not only focus on assembling products, but inventing in India as well. He said that assembling products will no doubt create jobs, but for newer substitutes, we need to do vigorous research. Underlining the importance of research, he said research converts money into knowledge and innovation converts knowledge into money, so both needs to go hand in hand for our nation to prosper. He emphasized that we have talent and technologies but now we need to build trust or believe in our capabilities. This is important because the post-COVID-19 world would be looking for an alternative destination to China as the trust on them is lost. And India has emerged as a viable alternative for which India needs to build proper logistics and adequate infrastructure to ease the process of doing business and build a favourable climate for foreign investments. He said that India’s fortune is going to change in a big way because she is recognised as one of the politically trusted countries of the world. He concluded by elucidating upon 10 Mashelkar mantras (or the 10 RAM Mantras), namely: (1) Aim high-Aspirations are your possibilities; (2) Perseverance; (3) We are always a part of the solution not the problem; (4) Create your own doors when all the other doors are closed; (5) Work hard in silence, let success make all the noise; (6) Three important attributes - Innovation, Passion, Compassion in the heart; (7) We can do anything but not everything - Focus on what you do; (8) Be positive; (9) New skills and new technologies are required as the world is changing; and (10) There is no limit to human imagination, human achievement, and human endurance. His message to the youth brigade is to believe that the best is yet to come and urged everybody to keep working hard and age should not be a deterrent, and that will only take our country to the zenith, which is his dream for an AtmanirbharBharat with ‘atmabishwas’.

Indigenous Indian COVID19 vaccines in the global race to end the pandemic, 04-Jul-2020,,"Dr TV Venkateswaran New Delhi, Jul 04 (India Science Wire): With the announcement of COVAXIN by Bharat Biotech and ZyCov-D Vaccine by Zydus Cadila the proverbial silver line in the dark clouds of COVID19 appears at the horizon. Now with the nod given by the Drug Controller General of India CDSCO (The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation) for the conduct of the human trial, it will take anywhere between fifteen to eighteen months before licence are issued for the vaccines. Nonetheless, this marks the beginning of the end. In the past years, India has emerged as one of the significant vaccine manufacturing hubs. Indian manufacturers account for 60% of vaccine supplies made to UNICEF. The vaccine for novel coronavirus may be developed anywhere in the world, but without Indian manufacturers involved the production of required quantity is not going to be feasible. Vaccine race More than 140 candidate vaccines are under various stages of development. One of the leading candidates is AZD1222 developed Jenner Institute of University of Oxford and licenced to AstraZeneca British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Cambridge, England. The MRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, Washington and taken up for production by the US-based Moderna pharmaceutical is just a step behind. Both these firms have already inked an agreement with Indian manufacturers for production of the COVID vaccines. Parallelly, Indian institutions have also engaged in R&D for the development of vaccines in India. With the primary scientific inputs coming from institutions like Pune based ICMR institution National Institute of Virology and Hyderabad based CSIR institution Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, six Indian companies are working on a vaccine for COVID-19. Along with the two Indian vaccines, COVAXIN and ZyCov-D, the world over, 11 out of 140 vaccine candidates have entered the human trials. None of these vaccines is unlikely to be ready for mass use before 2021. Immune system Antigen from the pathogen and antibodies produced by the human immune cells can be thought of as matching the blouse with a sari. Every pathogen has specific molecular structures called as antigen. They are like the saris with a particular hue and pallu. Once infected by the germ, the human immune system develops antibodies that match the antigen. Just as the retailer of blouse matching material stockpile hundreds of blouse pieces of riots of colours and hues, our immune system has ten thousand types of antibodies. If the pathogen is a known enemy, the immune system can pull the matching blouse piece from the stock. Once the match is made the pathogen is inactivated. No longer it can infect. However, if the microorganism is unfamiliar, and mainly when it has evolved for the first time,  there is no matching colour and hue in the repertoire.  Nonetheless, unlike the textile, the antibody can evolve. At first, near matches are tried. After various cycles of antibody development, the best fit matures. The time lag between the identification of the sari colour that is an antigen, and finding a pairing blouse piece, that is antibodies, is what makes the infection mild or severe. If only the immune system can neutralise the germ instantly, the infection can be prevented. Immune memory and vaccine Like a new hue of blouse piece once acquired is stocked for future, once the new antibody matching the antigen evolves, it is retained in the immunological memory. Next time the same pathogen invades, immunological memory is aroused, and twinned antibody is released. The infection is nipped in the bud. We acquire immunity. A vaccine is a method to artificially inducing the immunological memory. Once the antigens of the nasty pathogen are introduced, the immune system is triggered into developing pairing antibodies and immunological memory. There are many ways in which one can artificially stroke the immune system to develop antibodies and memory. The bottom line is presenting the antigens of the novel coronavirus to the human immune system. From adenovirus-based live-attenuated virus to recombinant genetic technology is used to develop several types of vaccines. Two among the various possibilities produced in India are inactivated virus vaccine and DNA plasmid vaccine. How these vaccines work We can inactivate a whole virus with heat or formaldehyde (that is 'killed'), yet keep the antigen molecular structures are still intact. However, the inactivated virus will not be able to infect or cause disease, as it is no longer functional. The Bharat Biotech's COVAXIN uses the virus isolated from an Indian patient by the National Institute of Virology to develop the inactivated virus vaccine. Novel coronavirus infects the human cells with the help of its spike proteins. The spike protein of the virus binds with the ACE2 receptors on the surface of the human respiratory tract cells. Once the virus fuse, the viral genome is slipped into the human cell where around a thousand copies of the virus are made in just ten hours. These baby viruses emigrate to nearby cells. Infection can be arrested if only we can deactivate the spike protein of the novel coronavirus.  Thus the antigen on the spike protein is a crucial vaccine target. If the antibody blocks the spike protein, then the virus cannot bind the cell and produce its offspring. The genomic code of the spike protein is spliced into a harmless DNA plasmid. This modified plasmid DNA with the genetic code of viral spike protein is introduced into the host cells. The cellular machinery translates the DNA and produces the viral protein encoded in the genome. The human immune system recognises the alien protein and develops a matching antibody. After this vaccination, if at any time, we are infected by the novel coronavirus, sensing the spike protein antibodies are released instantly. The immune killer cells seize deactivated viruses. Contagion is arrested even before infection. (India Science Wire)",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/7/4/Indigenous-Indian-COVID19-vaccines.html
Researchers develop battery-operated portable ventilator, 09-Jul-2020,Jyoti Singh,"New Delhi, Jul 08 (India Science Wire): The novel coronavirus pandemic has raised the demand of ventilators across the country. To meet the escalating demand researchers from Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) has developed an Emergency Breathing Assist System (EBAS), called AirBridge. The device is portable, battery-operated and user-friendly. Air Bridge can be used for ventilator support in COVID-19 related or non-Covid related emergency situations in hospital wards and during transportation of patients in ambulances. It can also be used in small hospitals without a central oxygen supply system using oxygen cylinders in emergency situations. “The device is not a replacement for a mechanical ventilator but works as a bridge for a few hours to a few days before conventional mechanical ventilation can be provided,’’ said SCTIMST director Dr Asha Kishore. The know-how and design of EBAS were transferred to Wipro 3D in April 2020 for further joint development. The product is ready for commercial production under the brand name ‘Air Bridge’.It has been jointly launched by SCTIMST and Wipro 3D Bangalore on Tuesday through video conference. A team of engineers Sarath S Nair, Vinod Kumar V and Nagesh D S from the department of medical device engineering and professors Thomas Koshy and Manikantan from the department of anaesthesia developed the specifications and technology.

India's second COVID-19 vaccine candidate 'ZyCoV' to start human trials, 16-Jul-2020,,"Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council  has announced  ZyCoV-D, the plasmid DNA vaccine designed and developed by Zydus and partially funded by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India has initiated Phase I/ II clinical trials in healthy subjects, making it the first indigenously developed vaccine for COVID-19 to be administered in humans in India. The adaptive Phase I/II dose escalation, multi-centric study will assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the vaccine. The human dosing of the vaccine marks a key milestone since the launching of the accelerated vaccine development programme for COVID-19 in February 2020. Dr.  Renu Swarup, Secretary, DBT and Chairperson, BIRAC said, “The Department of Biotechnology Government of India has partnered with Zydus to address rapid development of an indigenous vaccine for COVID-19 under the National Biopharma Mission. This partnership with Zydus is to serve the country’s need for a vaccine to fight the dreaded pandemic which has put a billion people at risk. Such research endeavours will help the country to develop preventive strategies for future disease outbreaks as well and exemplifies the government’s focus on creating an ecosystem that nurtures and encourages new product innovation to make real and measurable changes to issues most relevant to our society.” She also mentioned that, “This is an important milestone for AtmaNirbhar Bharat as Zydus begins human clinical trials for the indigenously developed vaccine. We hope, that the vaccine continues to show positive outcomes as it has done so far in the pre-clinical phase where it was found to be safe, immunogenic and well tolerated. This will be a big leap forward for Indian scientific research.” Speaking on the development, Chairman of Zydus Cadila, Mr. Pankaj R. Patel said, “This is a very important step in our fight against this pandemic and one that will help the nation combat this healthcare challenge. We are thankful to BIRAC and the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India for their support in our quest to provide a safe and efficacious vaccine to prevent COVID-19.” In the pre-clinical phase of ZyCoV-D, the vaccine was found to elicit a strong immune response in multiple animal species like mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. The antibodies produced by the vaccine were able to neutralize the wild type virus in virus neutralization assay indicating the protective potential of the vaccine candidate. No safety concerns were observed for the vaccine candidate in repeat dose toxicology studies by both intramuscular and intradermal routes of administration. In rabbits, up to three times the intended human dose was found to be safe, well tolerated and immunogenic. With ZyCoV-D, the Company has successfully established the DNA vaccine platform in the country using non-replicating and non-integrating plasmid carrying the gene of interest making it very safe. Further, no vector response and with absence of any infectious agent, the platform provides ease of manufacturing the vaccine with minimal biosafety requirements (BSL-1). The platform is also known to show much improved vaccine stability and lower cold chain requirements making it easy for transportation to remotest regions of the country. Furthermore, the platform can be rapidly used to modify the vaccine in couple of weeks in case the virus mutates to ensure that the vaccine still elicits protection. The Industry-Academia Collaborative Mission of Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Govt of India for accelerating discovery research to early development for Biopharmaceuticals approved by the Cabinet for a total cost US$ 250 million and 50% co-funded by the World Bank is being implemented at Biotechnology Research Assistance Council (BIRAC). This program is dedicated to deliver affordable products to the nation with an aim to improve the health standards of India’s population. Vaccines, medical devices and diagnostics and biotherapeutics are few of its most important domains, besides, strengthening the clinical trial capacity and building technology transfer capabilities in the country.

"ARCI & Vehant Technologies co-develop UV baggage disinfector for airports, railway stations", 17-Jul-2020,,"Domestic and International travel has been a major reason for spread of  COVID infection. Baggage, an inevitable part of travel involves handling by multiple people and can be contact points for spread of the virus and should be disinfected quickly each time they change hands. With increase in the passenger traffic at airports, railway stations and commercial establishments during the post-lockdown period, there is an immediate necessity for a rapid system for the baggage disinfection within few seconds to effectively fight against COVID-19. International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI), Hyderabad, an autonomous R&D Centre of Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India and Vehant Technologies, Noida have co-developed KritiScan UV Baggage Disinfection System in order to control spread of infection through baggage. The compact UVC conveyor system developed can efficiently disinfect the baggage passing through the conveyor within a few seconds and is suitable for use in airports, railway and bus stations, hotels, commercial and private establishments for rapid disinfection of baggage. UVC based disinfection systems are known for their rapid disinfection capability, and the disinfection process is dry and chemical-free. UVC irradiation at 254 nm is known for its germicidal properties where no chemical residues are left behind. UVC light, when irradiated on an infected surface, quickly disrupts the genetic material in the virus and thus inhibits its multiplication. The KritiScan UV advanced baggage disinfecting system has a specially designed motorized conveyor to guide the baggage into the disinfection tunnel, which uses UVC light (254 nm) with appropriate irradiance to inactivate microbes and viruses. The UV-C lamps used in the system are well shielded and hence pose no harm to staff or passengers in the vicinity of the system. However, any human intervention is strongly advised against when the UVC sources are on. “ARCI with its past experience in UVC based disinfection systems provided inputs such as UV dosage levels and guidance in mapping the UVC intensities in the disinfection tunnel so that required intensity is available at all requisite locations. Vehant Technologies, with its prior experience and expertise in developing and producing KritiScan UV Baggage Disinfection Systems, has been able to develop KritiScan UVC system in recordtime“. said, Dr G. Padmanabhan, Director, International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI). “Vehant Technologies has been working round the clock during this COVID-19 crisis with the sole aim of keeping people safe. Since baggage of the passengers can be a medium of the spread of the infection, we have jointly developed KritiScan® UV Baggage Disinfection system with ARCI.The sensing mechanism in the chamber automatically detects the entry of any item into it and powers the system and disinfects the 360-degree surface of any baggage,” said Mr Kapil Bardeja, CEO and Co-Founder, Vehant Technologies. “A slew of innovations such as this are making travel safe in the time of virus to allow economic growth while fully addressing the health concerns,” said Prof Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST. Systems can be deployed as per baggage size with various tunnel sizes for different purposes and locations and each model type being able to operate at different conveyor speeds.

Historic reforms initiated in Space sector: Union Cabinet approves Private sector participation in Space activities, 25-Jun-2020,,"The decision will accelerate growth of the space sector and enable Indian Industry to be an important player in global space economy. It will also generate large-scale employment in the sector. Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on June 24, approved far reaching reforms in the Space sector aimed at boosting private sector participation in the entire range of space activities. A press release from the PMO said that the decision taken was in line with the long-term vision of the Prime Minister of transforming India and making the country self-reliant and technologically advanced. India is among a handful of countries with advanced capabilities in the space sector. With these reforms, the sector will receive new energy and dynamism, to help the country leapfrog to the next stages of space activities. As of today, government owned ISRO is the only organisation in India that involves in space activities. However, ISRO has many sub-contractors in the private sector manufacturing few parts for its projects but none are involved in space activities per se. The involvement of private sector will not only result in an accelerated growth of the space sector but will enable Indian Industry to be an important player in global space economy. With this, there is an opportunity for large-scale employment in the technology sector and India becoming a Global technology powerhouse. IN-SPACe Initiated Benefits Private Sector in Space Space sector can play a major catalytic role in the technological advancement and expansion of our Industrial base. The proposed reforms will enhance the socio-economic use of space assets and activities, including through improved access to space assets, data and facilities. The newly created Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) will provide a level playing field for private companies to use Indian space infrastructure. It will also hand-hold, promote and guide the private industries in space activities through encouraging policies and a friendly regulatory environment. The Public Sector Enterprise ‘New Space India Limited (NSIL)’ will endeavour to re-orient space activities from a ‘supply driven’ model to a ‘demand driven’ model, thereby ensuring optimum utilization of our space assets. These reforms will allow ISRO to focus more on research and development activities, new technologies, exploration missions and human spaceflight programme. Some of the planetary exploration missions will also be opened up to private sector through an ‘announcement of opportunity’ mechanism.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/6/25/Union-Cabinet-approves-Private-sector-participation-in-Space-activities.html

CSIR to carry study to ascertain is COVID-19 airborne or not, 24-Jul-2020,Jyoti Singh,"After the World Health Organisation recent acknowledgement that there is emerging evidence of airborne spread of the novel coronavirus whole scientific community has started looking at the mode of transmission of novel coronavirus with a different perspective. Director-General, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (DG-CSIR), Dr Shekhar C Mandesaid in a blog post “Airborne transmission of COVID possible, wear masks in enclosed spaces”. Is novel coronavirus really transmitting through air? To answer this question  Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH) in Chandigarh and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad, two labs under the CSIR are gearing up to conduct study. When we sneeze, cough, talk or sing, droplets are sprayed from our mouth. Some of the droplets, which are bigger drop to the ground like a ball thrown from a height. These larger droplets then settle on the surfaces. If the person is infected then inhalation of the droplets or touching the droplets on the surface can transmit the virus. Like a feather that stays longer in the air, lifted up by air currents, smaller droplets remain suspended in the air for sometime.  If people at crowded places come in contact of these droplets there is a potential threat of spread through these small droplets. The virus laden droplets is unlikely in an open park, or a public road. However, in enclosed spaces, an infected person can leave a trail of small droplets with virus suspended in the air. What are potential places? One needs to do actually study by taking air sample in the first place.  “We are in talks with the state governments to allow us to go to some of the areas where there is possibility of virus, we can look for hospital ICUs, isolation centres or public transports” said Dr SanjeevKhosla, Director, IMTECH, Chandigarh. The air sampling is done through specialised machines. These have a suction pump that draw air. The air sample goes through a filter at the end of the instrument. The filter traps the airbornemicro-organisms.  “We will be taking in some amount of air from a particular area based on calculations that we would do that how far these air droplets can move and then try to see whether these air droplets have the virus and how far we can detect them” said Dr Khosla. To ensure that the machine doesn’t get contaminated the filters and the suction pump are cleaned up after every collection. The machines are patented devices and are being used to trap other micro-organisms too.  Once the sampling is done it would analysed for presence of various pathogens including novel coronavirus. “But sampling may take time, as one has to repeat the experiments as contamination need to be taken care of” said Dr Khosla.

Surat school girls discover an Earth-bound asteroid by scanning through images from University of Hawaii telescope, 29-Jul-2020,,"Vaidehi Vekariya Sanjaybhai (top right), and Radhika Lakhani Prafulbhai (bottom right) who discovered the asteroid HLV2514 (Pic source: Space India) Two 14-year old Surat school girls have discovered an Earth-bound asteroid by scanning through images from the University of Hawaii telescope. Their discovery was announced by Space India institute on Monday. Space India wrote ""We are proud to announce VAIDEHI VEKARIYA SANJAYBHAI and RADHIKA LAKHANI PRAFULBHAI, two students of P.P. SAVANI CHAITANYA VIDYA SANKUL (CBSE) from Surat with the help of SPACE-AIASC discovered a new Asteroid which is a Near-Earth Object named HLV2514"", on Twitter. Both Vaidehi Vekariya and Radhika Lakhani hail from Surat and study at Savani Chaitanya Vidya Sankul. They discovered the object as part of an asteroid search campaign conducted by SPACE India along with the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC), a NASA-affiliated citizen scientist group. The discovery by the two Surat girls has caught the attention of the world and are receiving accolades from all over for their efforts and interest. Speaking to the media  Vaidehi Vekariya and Radhika Lakhani received their training in astronomy and far-object discovery from Space India. The girls used specialized software to analyse the images taken by the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii, and made the discovery in June, SPACE India said. Reuters has reported that IASC Director J. Patrick Miller confirmed the discovery, according to an email from him to the girls. The asteroid HLV2514 is presently near Mars and its orbit is expected to cross that of Earth in about one million years’ time, as per the information shared by Space India. The asteroid will be officially named only after NASA confirms its orbit. Asteroids and comets pose a potential threat to Earth and scientists discover thousands of them each year.

"IISC and ISRO develop Space bricks for lunar habitation, a significant step in space exploration", 15-Aug-2020,,"A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has developed a sustainable process for making brick-like structures on the moon, as per  The cost of sending one pound of material to outer space is about Rs. 7.5 lakh. The process developed by the IISc and ISRO team uses urea — which can be sourced from human urine — and lunar soil as raw materials for construction on the moon’s surface. This decreases the overall expenditure considerably. The process also has a lower carbon footprint because it uses guar gum instead of cement for support. This could also be exploited to make sustainable bricks on Earth. Aloke Kumar, Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IISc, one of the authors of two studies published in Ceramics International and PLOS One says that the development of the ""space bricks"" is exciting as it brings two different fields — biology and mechanical engineering — together. “Living organisms have been involved in such mineral precipitation since the dawn of the Cambrian period, and modern science has now found a use for them,” says Aloke Kumar. To exploit this ability, Kumar and colleagues at IISc teamed up with ISRO scientists Arjun Dey and I Venugopal. They first mixed the bacteria with a simulant of lunar soil. Then, they added the required urea and calcium sources along with gum extracted from locally-sourced guar beans. The guar gum was added to increase the strength of the material by serving as a scaffold for carbonate precipitation. The final product obtained after a few days of incubation was found to possess significant strength and machinability. Koushik Viswanathan, Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, IISc, another author explains that the 'Space Bricks' could be fabricated into any freeform shape using a simple lathe. ""This is advantageous because this completely circumvents the need for specialised moulds – a common problem when trying to make a variety of shapes by casting. This capability could also be exploited to make intricate interlocking structures for construction on the moon, without the need for additional fastening mechanisms”, he said. The authors believe that this is the first significant step towards constructing buildings in space. “We have quite a distance to go before we look at extra-terrestrial habitats. Our next step is to make larger bricks with a more automated and parallel production process,” says Kumar. “Simultaneously, we would also like to further enhance the strength of these bricks and test them under varied loading conditions like impacts and possibly moonquakes.” Space exploration has grown exponentially in the last century. With Earth’s resources dwindling rapidly, scientists have intensified their efforts to inhabit the moon and possibly other planets.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/8/15/IISC-and-ISRO-develop-Space-bricks-for-lunar-habitation.html

Transforming Education Through Technology, 04-Sep-2020,-Dr Anamika Gulati,"The National Education Policy 2020 is designed keeping in mind the local and global needs of the country. There is proper inclusion of diversity and culture. Technology will be widely used to popularize diverse languages and language learning and teaching The push towards technology and digitisation will bring a transformation With the advent of Covid-19, the world has explored the technology to the highest level and made use of it in almost every field of life; education was one such area where use of technology opened the new gateways of learning. India may not have been among the first countries to use technology in the field of education but with the increasing high-speed broadband internet access and low-cost computers and mobile devices over the years, there is now internet facility in every household which paved the way for e-learning. Indeed government points to extend advanced education of the nation by bringing out favourable approaches to provide a driving force to innovation based learning and digital learning. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 highlighted the important role of technological aspects in our education system and has given a clear roadmap to move forward. This revised policy stressed upon the fact that all students, irrespective of their place of residence, should get a quality education system, with particular focus on historically marginalized, disadvantaged, and underrepresented groups as education is the best overall leveller. Initiatives must be practiced to ensure that all students from such groups, despite having multiple hindrances, are provided platforms to enter and outshine in the educational system.

"Self-check kiosk to detect, prevent Covid-19", 09-Sep-2020,,"India Science Wire:  The fully automated touchless self-check kiosk has been designed as per the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. It instantly detects and records the syndromes associated with COVID-19 like body temperature and blood oxygen content and raises the alarm in case it is beyond the limits. The Kiosk features a first of its kind UV-C disinfectant box capable of killing viruses/bacteria present on the surfaces of luggage, bags, keys, mobiles, wallets etc. thereby reducing the risk of spreading. The following steps are involved when a person enters the premise. The person has to stand on the footmarks marked in front of the kiosk after removing the face mask and align the face in the grid displayed on the screen to measure the body temperature. Once the temperature is measured, the individual will have to wave its hand over the sensor of the UV-C chamber to open its door for keeping the belongings inside. UV-C box will perform 360⁰ disinfection on the entire exposed surface. The individual will have to place its index finger on the SpO₂ sensor to check the oxygen saturation in the body (Oxygen above 95% is a sign of a healthy human body). After this, the individual can disinfect the hands by placing them below the automatic sanitiser dispenser unit. Post hand sanitisation, the individual can collect the belongings from UV-C chamber and can proceed further. A self-check kiosk has already been installed at IIT Guwahati campus.

Dangers from the Digital World, 21-Sep-2020,,"Atul Sehgal The present world is the digital world. The advent of computers, the internet, mobile telephony and related digital devices has dramatically transformed our systems of working. It is also gradually transforming our living paradigms. It seems that these devices are indispensable in our life because all our systems have become overly dependent on information technology. In the above backdrop, it makes good sense to reflect on the past three decades and critically examine what net benefits have accrued to the world from widespread adoption of IT in all walks of life. The results of this exercise would, no doubt, provide useful inputs for chartering the way ahead. It is worth recalling that computers were invented as labour-saving devices. They were meant to replace humans for performing stereotyped, repetitive work involving mathematical calculations. This was the first application of electronic computers. Later they were employed for typing, modifying, storing and retrieving all sorts of information — numerical and verbal. Volumes and volumes of texts could be stored in the digital memory systems of computers. The invention of the internet brought further, more dramatic changes in our working systems. The marriage of computers and the internet led to the development of mobile telephone sets. The mobile set today is a virtual office, photographer, music and cinema album, radio set, television set, catalogue, file, textbook, library, archive, telephone, conference room, the marketplace, cash purse —all rolled into one. The development of programmes and speciality software for a host of applications affected the visible reduction of computational time and effort in all areas of working. If the saving of manual labour and computational efficiency improvement was the prime purpose of developing digital devices and the related programming software, this purpose has been remarkably achieved. But what have been the tangible benefits of this? Let us cast a dispassionate look by posing some straightforward questions related to the effects of digital devices. Have digital devices made a living more comfortable and convenient? Did they increase productivity and income significantly? Did they contribute to improvement in human health, nutrition and longevity? Have they increased global trade and cultural exchange? Have they reduced cultural barriers among humans? Have they increased permissiveness in global society? Have they strengthened the bonds of fraternity and camaraderie? Have they enhanced global peace and security? Have they made humans more informed? Or more knowledgeable? Or more learned? Have they enhanced the happiness quotient of global humans? Have they made humans more logical and less superstitious? Have they enabled better governance? Have they promoted scientific developments without damaging the environment? Getting true answers to the above questions could form the objective of an interesting set of study and research projects. But, undeniably, it is not difficult to see and can be reasonably stated that — The present age is the age of information blitzkrieg, marked by excessive flow of information, often incoherent, incomplete and incongruent. The excessive flow of information has not enhanced the knowledge and understanding of subjects but made people confused and muddled on things. Originality, creativity, innovativeness seem to have declined, and their space has been occupied by information bytes coming from mechanical dependence on digital devices. The real world is slowly and inexorably giving way to the virtual world of Facebook, Google, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter etc. Relationships have grown transient, superficial and selfish. Economic and other crimes have not dwindled but increased in a way. Cybercriminals and account hackers are the new creeds of criminals. Humans have become palpably more materialistic and less spiritualistic, less religious. The disparity of wealth among the global population has widened further. The arms race has not slowed down; hegemonic tendencies on the part of nations are more visible than before, and global peace appears to be a more distant dream. The digital revolution is bringing forth Artificial Intelligence-based devices, including robots, to replace humans in factories and farm fields. The internet-based mobile telephony works through low-frequency microwave radiation which has filled the lower layer of troposphere. As per the panchbhut theory of ancient Indian scholars, this constitutes the pollution of ether (akash). It is suspected to have Its adverse effects on humans, animals and plants which have not been even looked at, far from being exhaustively researched. There is a strong suspicion that the grave deleterious effects of microwave radiation pollution of the ethereal space may only be waiting to erupt. The AI (artificial intelligence) revolution is fraught with the dangers of job loss and economic deprivation on a gigantic scale. Truly, the whole concept of digitisation and automation is the offshoot of capitalism. This system has bred inequality and insecurity across the world, leading to violent struggles by the have-nots and deprived. History has proved time and again that capitalism is anti-peace and anti-development because it creates a huge, unnatural and unsustainable economic disparity in the context of the global ecosphere and the larger global population. Our modern scientists, economists and sociologists along with politicians and policy planners need to pause and take a hard look at the lurking severe dangers of the digital information systems that can have a devastating effect on peace, health and economic security of the global population in the times to come.",https://www.organiser.org//Encyc/2020/9/21/Dangers-from-the-Digital-World.html
Economical COVID-19 test ‘COVIRAP’ gets ICMR certification, 22-Oct-2020,,"Tray containing the essential apparatus to conduct the tests RT-PCR for detecting COVID-19 is a standard test. The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-Kharagpur) has developed a diagnostic machine that gives as close results as ones produced by RT-PCR test. The diagnostic machine‘COVIRAP’has been successfully validated for its efficacy in COVID-19 detection by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The machine is portable, low-cost, and user-friendly that can be used in the field, anywhere. ""The machine can determine the results of a given sample in less than an hour. It can be set up in the middle of a field and doesn't require an air-conditioned laboratory. In fact, most of the testing done during the development process was conducted out in the open to test the efficacy of the machine,"" said Prof SumanChakraborty, Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IITKharagpur. While explaining the working mechanism of the machine Prof. Chakrabortysaid ""Each testing kit contains three master mixes which can confirm the presence of the virus. After the RNA sample is collected, it is mixed with master mixes and heated to a certain temperature after being inserted in the pre-programmed machine. This is quite like what is done in other tests as well. However, there is a second heating step which is exclusive to this device and has been patented, which makes the machine unique. After the heating processes are completed, the RNA samples are put on a strip. Whether a patient is COVID-19 positive or negative is dependent on whether lines appear on the strips or not. The strips are then inserted in a cartridge in the machine from where the app uses the camera and inbuilt analytical tool to determine whether the test is positive or negative."" Sensitivity and specificity are the two common parameters used as indicators of efficacy of any diagnostic test. The machine displayed over 93% sensitivity and almost 98% specificity in its results. ""The samples of various patients can be tested at once and that makes the machine quite scalable,"" declared Prof Chakraborty. The cost of the machine is around Rs 5,000 and one test will cost between Rs 500-600. ""The whole machine and testing process were developed by the institute itself during the lockdown, nothing has been imported from outside. We are hoping that the per-test cost will decrease once the COVIRAP is mass-produced,"" said Dr Chakraborty. Elaborating on the validation process of ‘COVIRAP’ Diagnostic Test, Dr.MamtaChawlaSarkar, an Internationally acclaimed virologist who oversaw the patient trials on behalf of ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) said, “A detailed scrutiny of the testing results has clearly shown that this assay holds the capability of detecting extremely low levels of viral loads that any other method based on similar principles of testing, even those from the most celebrated research groups across the world, could not come up with so far. In practice, this means that very early stages of infection can be detected, thereby isolating the patient and arresting the uncontrolled spread of infection in the community via asymptomatic patients.” Speaking about the commercialization of ‘COVIRAP,’ Prof. V.K. Tewari, Director, IIT Kharagpur said, “While the Institute can produce the testing kit up to a certain scale, patent licensing will facilitate commercialization opportunities for medical technology companies. Any corporate or start-up can approach the Institute for technology licensing and commercial scale of production. The Institute is open to tie-ups, with due measures of protecting the interest of public health amidst the pandemic situation.”Subsequent financial support to this project was provided by the IIT Foundation, USA, to meet the various expenses in the clinical testing phase. Partial financial support has also been provided from the Common Research and Technology Development Hub on Affordable Healthcare, established by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), at IIT Kharagpur.
